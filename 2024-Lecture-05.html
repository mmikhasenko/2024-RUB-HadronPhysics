<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recap-of-phase-space-and-kinematics-in-particle-scattering">Recap of Phase Space and Kinematics in Particle Scattering</h2>
<p>I hope one day you receive more extensive notes from me than the bullet points I usually send, as I record myself and later use a language model to produce a PDF script, which is currently not ideal. Still, some points I discuss are mentioned, which helps me later when developing the material.</p>
<p>Today we are at lecture number five, where we will discuss angle distributions and partial wave analysis. Before proceeding, I’d like to recap the last lecture. We discussed the phase space for particle reactions and the kinematics of different experiments. We reviewed a list of experiments worldwide studying hadrons, their production mechanisms, and peculiarities.</p>
<p>We begin with a recap on kinematics. The first question is: <strong>How many variables are needed to describe a <span class="math inline">\(2 \to 2\)</span> scattering process?</strong></p>
<p>For scalar particles (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(0^-\)</span> scattering to <span class="math inline">\(0^-\)</span>), the number of variables is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
2(2)(4-1) - 4 = 8 \ \text{variables from conservation laws}
\]</span></p>
<p>This accounts for the degrees of freedom constrained by momentum and energy conservation.</p>
<p>The second question involves spin. For example, consider <span class="math inline">\(P^+\)</span> scattering from <span class="math inline">\(0^-\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(3^-\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1^+\)</span>. The process is represented by a “blob” diagram, indicating the interaction region where strong interaction dynamics occur. The lines represent incoming and outgoing particles.</p>

<p>These are not Feynman diagrams but are sometimes called <em>unitarity diagrams</em>. We will discuss unitarity in later lectures.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For now, this diagram serves as a visual aid for the kinematics. The task is to calculate the number of variables required to fully describe the process, focusing only on kinematics—what happens inside the blob is not considered here.</p>

<p>We are talking only about kinematics at this point. Whatever happens in the blob does not impact the answer. The blob could represent electromagnetic, strong, or gravity interactions—anything you want. The question is how many variables are needed to describe the process. There are two possibilities: particles without spin and particles carrying spin.</p>
<p>For scalar particles (no spin), the number of variables is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
2(2)(4-1) - 4 = 8 \ \text{variables from conservation laws}
\]</span></p>
<p>This accounts for the degrees of freedom constrained by momentum and energy conservation. However, we can further reduce this by considering that there is no fixed reference frame or orientation in space. We subtract an additional six variables (three rotations and three boosts), leaving us with:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
8 - 6 = 2 \ \text{variables from rotations}
\]</span></p>
<p>For part (A), the answer is two variables.</p>
<p>For part (B), when particles carry spin, the counting changes. The exact number depends on the spin configurations of the incoming and outgoing particles.</p>

<p>These calculations focus purely on kinematics—what happens inside the blob (interaction region) is not considered here.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The example in part (C) asks for a combination of variables that fully describe the process, such as angles or invariant masses. The key takeaway is that after accounting for conservation laws and frame invariance, only two independent variables remain for scalar particles in a <span class="math inline">\(2 \to 2\)</span> scattering process.</p>

<p>For part (A), you have two variables. For part (B), you have the two from the previous center and the angular distribution of the laser particles of the production. Since there is no decay information, just a <span class="math inline">\(2 \to 2\)</span> process, the total is 4 variables. These include the angle between the two production particles and the angle between the <span class="math inline">\(3^-\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1^+\)</span> particles.</p>
<p>The scalar amplitude describes the amplitude as a function of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, where:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S = (p_1 + p_2)^2
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
T = (p_1 - p_3)^2
\]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> represents the energy of the system (sum of four-vectors squared), and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> describes the transferred momentum in the vertical direction. The four-vectors <span class="math inline">\(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\)</span> include energy, three-dimensional momentum components, and helicity values (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda_3, \lambda_4\)</span>) for particles with spin.</p>
<p>For scalar particles, the amplitude is a single number. However, for particles with spin, the scattering amplitude becomes a higher-rank object. For example:<br>
- Spin-3 particles introduce 7 dimensions.<br>
- Spin-1 particles introduce 3 dimensions.</p>
<p>Thus, the total scattering amplitude becomes a 21-dimensional object, representing 21 amplitudes. All these amplitudes are functions of the same two variables (<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>).</p>

<p>The situation changes if decays of the final-state particles are considered. However, if restricted to the <span class="math inline">\(2 \to 2\)</span> process, only two variables are needed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For part (C), the favorite variables to describe a two-body scattering process could be the mass of particle one and two, or particle one and three. To compute the mass of two particles, you take the four-vector of the first particle, add it to the four-vector of the second, and compute the Lorentz invariant:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
m^2 = (E_1 + E_2)^2 - (\vec{p}_1 + \vec{p}_2)^2
\]</span></p>
<p>This gives the invariant mass squared of the system. Essentially, one of the variables is <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> (the Mandelstam variable), and another could be constructed similarly.</p>

<p>The Mandelstam variable <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> can be defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
t = (p_1 - p_3)^2 = (p_2 + p_4)^2 = m_{24}^2
\]</span></p>
<p>It is common to assign particles in the final state with a minus sign and those in the initial state with a plus sign. This convention helps define the Mandelstam variables <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, which are invariants. These quantities characterize the entire decay or scattering process and are Lorentz invariant, meaning they do not depend on a specific reference frame.</p>
<p>The term “invariants” may not be found in some dictionaries, but it is widely used in physics to describe these frame-independent variables. For example, <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> are such invariants.</p>
<p>The scalar amplitude is a function of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, where:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kinematic-variables-and-their-independence-in-particle-decays">Kinematic Variables and Their Independence in Particle Decays</h2>
<p>We can call these variables invariants. Let’s discuss examples of such sets. One example is <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, but we need two variables to fully describe the process. Another variable is <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
U = (p_2 - p_4)^2 = (p_1 - p_3)^2
\]</span></p>
<p>However, <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is not independent because it is a linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.

<p>Another useful choice is the center-of-mass energy ( <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{S}\)</span> ) and the scattering angle. The angle is defined in the center-of-momentum frame, where the total momentum of all particles sums to zero. For example, if we have momenta <span class="math inline">\(p_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_3\)</span>, the angle between them characterizes the kinematics.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-to-3-body-decay-kinematics-and-dalitz-plots">Introduction to 3-Body Decay Kinematics and Dalitz Plots</h2>
<p>The homework exercise involved a Dalitz plot, which is now part of our lectures. This marks a shift in the course, where we transition from overlapping topics with particle physics to material specific to hadron spectroscopy. One key subject we will explore is particle representation, particularly in three-body decays.</p>
<p>The Dalitz plot is a common technique to study the dynamics of interactions in such decays. For a three-body decay, the diagram involves one incoming leg and three outgoing legs, with the “blob” representing the interaction. The number of kinematic variables remains the same as before, determined by the number of legs.</p>
<p>For decays like <span class="math inline">\(3\pi\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(DDK\)</span>, two variables fully describe the process. Given these two variables—whether <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, angles, or others—the entire kinematics can be reconstructed. Think of it like a rigid body: if you 3D-print a blob with fixed vectors sticking out, the angles and lengths of the vectors are fixed, defining the kinematic configuration. The same applies to a three-body decay—just two variables are needed to visualize the decay in the center-of-mass frame.</p>
<p>The variables <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> are examples of invariants used to describe the process.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="definition-and-properties-of-mandelstam-variables-in-kinematics">Definition and Properties of Mandelstam Variables in Kinematics</h2>
<p>In the center-of-mass frame, we can visualize the kinematics by drawing two vectors representing the outgoing momenta. The configuration is determined by the angles and lengths of these vectors.</p>
<p>The Mandelstam variables <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> are defined analogously for processes with different particles in the final state. The transformation between kinematic configurations involves flipping the sign of a momentum. For example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S = (p_1 + p_2)^2 = (p_3 + p_4)^2
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
T = (p_1 - p_3)^2
\]</span></p>
<p>There was a typo in the notation where <span class="math inline">\(p_1\)</span> should represent the decaying particle, but we will proceed with the current notation for clarity.</p>
<p>The phase space integration factor for a three-body decay is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dm_{12}^2}{2\pi} \frac{2P}{2p'} dm_{x}^2 m_x
\]</span></p>
<p>This describes the differential phase space volume involving the invariant masses <span class="math inline">\(m_{12}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_x\)</span>, along with momenta <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p'\)</span>.</p>
<p>The phase space for <span class="math inline">\(3 \to DDK\)</span> is flat in the variables <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, meaning it is constant when expressed in terms of these invariants. Substituting the two-body phase spaces and applying the proper kinematic transformations yields a factor of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\)</span>. This arises from combining the phase space contributions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{8\pi} \frac{2P}{\sqrt{S}}
\]</span></p>
<p>for each two-body subsystem. The squared term comes from the product of two such phase space elements.</p>
<p>The recursive formula discussed in the previous lecture simplifies the calculation when substituting the phase space variables. The final result includes the invariant mass terms and momentum dependencies, reflecting the kinematic constraints of the decay process.</p>

<p>The phase space integration factor involves terms like <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2P}{\sqrt{S}}\)</span>. Each momentum space contribution includes a factor of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{1}{8\pi^2} \frac{2P}{\sqrt{S}}\)</span>, along with a solid angle term <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3D \Omega}{4\pi}\)</span>. These factors simplify in the high-energy limit, where they approach unity, leaving a unit integral if no additional dependencies are present.</p>
<p>For three-body decays, the cosine of the scattering angle <span class="math inline">\(\cos \theta\)</span> can be expressed in terms of invariant masses like <span class="math inline">\(m_{34}\)</span>. The momentum factor <span class="math inline">\(2P\)</span> appears in the Jacobian when replacing <span class="math inline">\(E'\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. This transformation introduces a Jacobian, though the speaker notes uncertainty about its exact form.</p>
<p>The recursive formula for three-body phase space reveals that the Jacobian for transforming to paired mass variables (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(m_{23}^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m_{24}^2\)</span>) is constant. This means the differential width or cross section, when plotted against these variables, shows no additional density variations. The choice of Mandelstam variables (or linearly related ones) is particularly powerful because they provide an undistorted representation of the interaction dynamics.</p>
<p>For example, plotting the differential width against <span class="math inline">\(m_{34}^2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(m_{23}^2\)</span> yields a constant density, reflecting the underlying physics without kinematic distortions. This property makes Mandelstam variables ideal for analyzing three-body processes, as they directly reveal the interaction structure.</p>
<p>The phase space integration for a <span class="math inline">\(3 \to DDK\)</span> decay is flat in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, meaning it is constant when expressed in these invariants. Combining two-body phase space elements introduces a factor of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\)</span>, derived from terms like <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{8\pi} \frac{2P}{\sqrt{S}}\)</span> for each subsystem. The recursive formula simplifies the substitution of phase space variables, leaving invariant mass terms and momentum dependencies that encode the kinematic constraints of the decay.</p>

<p>We have a good sample and understanding of their decay kinematics and dynamics. In this decay, a charm quark (<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>) is present in the initial state but absent in the final state, confirming weak interaction mediation.

<p>This decay process is the golden channel for registration because the final state contains three charged particles with no neutrals. The proton is a stable charged particle that travels well, the kaon is stable in our accelerator experiments, and the pion is also stable. These particles fly directly from the decay without distraction, leaving clear tracks through all detectors.</p>
<p>We observe these tracks pointing away from the primary interaction vertex, with a shift of around 10 millimeters in LHC energies between the primary and secondary vertices. This displacement is due to the boost of the lambda particle in the laboratory frame, where it lives longer than in its rest frame. The lambda is produced with energies of a few hundred GeV in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, making this decay particularly well-suited for study.</p>
<p>Here is the result of the analysis, which closely resembles experimental data. The statistics are so high that the distribution appears smooth.</p>

<p>For the three-body decay, there is a standard way to define the angle. Let me illustrate this with a setup involving a proton, kaon (<span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>), and pion (<span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>).</p>
<p>First, I boost into the center-of-momentum frame for the system. In this frame, the three particles are arranged such that their momenta sum to zero.

<p>By fixing the mass of the <span class="math inline">\(K\pi\)</span> system, we can explore the phase space along a line where the masses of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> are held constant.

<p>The corner angle is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. The right coordinate should be zero and the left should reflect this. In this setup, the proton and the kaon (<span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>) go in opposite directions, which corresponds to the maximum mass of the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> system. For this configuration, the lengths of all vectors are fixed, and only rotation is possible.</p>
<p>The mass dependence of two particles can be expressed as a function of the angle between them: the wider the angle, the larger the mass. For the proton-kaon system, when the angle is zero, the mass is very high. When the particles move almost in the same direction, their mass is small. The same logic applies to the other half of the system.</p>
<p>The most straightforward way to analyze this is to work in the rest frame of the proton-kaon system, where all momenta are fixed. By scanning along this line, we change the angle of the pair relative to the rest frame. This describes the setup where the angle is varied in one frame or another.</p>
<p>There is a third variable in the <span class="math inline">\(2 \to 2\)</span> scattering process, called <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, which introduces additional symmetry. For a three-particle system (pion, proton, kaon), the mass of the pion-proton pair is not immediately evident. If we fix the mass of this system and scan the angle, the motion along the line is determined by the relation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
U = m_{\pi p}^2 + m_{K p}^2 + m_{K \pi}^2 - \text{const.}
\]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is a linear combination of the other two mass variables, with coefficients of one. This results in a diagonal line in the Dalitz plot. Fixing the mass of the pion-proton system corresponds to moving along this diagonal, transitioning from one corner to another.</p>
<p>The standard experimental representation of a Dalitz plot places the mass of one pair on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis and the mass of another pair on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis. However, a more symmetric representation exists, where all variables are treated equally. This uses the properties of an equilateral triangle: for any point inside, the sum of the distances to the sides is constant.</p>
<p>In this symmetric representation, the masses of the particles correspond to the distances to the sides of the equilateral triangle. This allows for a fully symmetric treatment of the variables, where the masses are summed in a balanced way. The transformation between the standard and symmetric representations is not just a rotation but a skew, involving a linear transformation.</p>
<p>The relation between Cartesian coordinates and the heights of the equilateral triangle involves a factor of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{3}/2\)</span> due to the 60-degree angles. This symmetric representation is elegant, but the standard representation is more practical for plotting, as it avoids the need for this transformation. Both methods fully describe the kinematics of the system.</p>

<p>The kinematic representation shows points where the density increases, helping us understand the dynamics and processes guiding the interaction. In future lectures, we will see that the decay process is not just <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_C \to 3\)</span> particles but proceeds via intermediate resonances. For a short moment, two particles form an intermediate state that dissociates, increasing the decay probability.</p>
<p>When the energy is adjusted into a certain range, the probability for this process becomes higher because the particles interact more strongly. This is analogous to hadronic resonances in two-particle cross sections, where a “bump” appears. The physics behind this is that the quantum numbers of the two-particle system match those of an intermediate resonance. By tuning the system’s energy, we observe how likely the particles are to interact at that energy.</p>

<p>The mass dependence of two particles can be expressed as a function of the angle between them: the wider the angle, the larger the mass. For example, in a proton-kaon system, when the angle is zero, the mass is very high, while particles moving in nearly the same direction have a small mass.</p>

<p>We now discuss angular distribution for a decay within one band. Consider the phase space resonance here. As previously discussed, when traversing the Dalitz plot while keeping the mass of the combination fixed, we explore different angles. This is precisely the kinematics.</p>
<p>In the rest frame of the <span class="math inline">\(K\pi\)</span> system, traversing the phase space by changing the angle reveals an angular dependence.

<p>This preference arises because particles have spin. The intermediate resonance (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(K^*\)</span>) is not a scalar particle; its spin introduces inhomogeneity in angular distributions and the Dalitz plot.</p>
<p>Angular distribution is a powerful tool for understanding particle properties. It allows us to measure spin, parity, and other quantum numbers in particle interactions.

<p>If there are no asymmetries at all and no structures in angular distributions, we can examine the ratio of aligned kinematics to other types of kinematics by looking at the angular distribution, especially in the rest frame of the particle decay. This allows us to infer information about the spin.</p>
<p>For most particles discovered so far, the quantum numbers are not initially known.

This is often as simple as examining the Dalitz plot and checking for minima or structures in the angular distribution.</p>
<p>The presence of nodes in the angular distribution directly indicates the spin of the particle if the final state consists of scalar particles. Specifically:<br>
- One node corresponds to spin-1.<br>
- Two nodes correspond to spin-2.<br>
- Three nodes correspond to spin-3.</p>
<p>The intensity of the distribution reflects these spin-dependent patterns.</p>

<p>If you have three nodes, you have spin three. The intensity would vanish at certain points in the dark spot. For non-scalar particles, which are most interacting particles, the situation is more complicated. Here, scalar resonances serve as an example.</p>
<p>The spin of a proton is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>, and the spin of <span class="math inline">\(K^+\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is zero since they are scalars. The spin of <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> is the same as the proton, but the presence of spin averages out the distribution. If you consider a specific spin projection of <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_c\)</span> and the proton, you would observe nodes and zeros in the angular distribution. However, since we neither polarize the initial state <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> nor measure the spin of the final state, everything is averaged, and the minima or nodes disappear.</p>
<p>A particle with spin <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> can have <span class="math inline">\(2J + 1\)</span> projections onto the quantization axis. Consider a particle with spin <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> and a <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis for spin quantization. The operator <span class="math inline">\(J_z\)</span> acting on the state <span class="math inline">\(|Jm\rangle\)</span> yields:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
J_z |Jm\rangle = m |Jm\rangle
\]</span></p>
<p>The state <span class="math inline">\(|Jm\rangle\)</span> can be represented as a vector with <span class="math inline">\(2J + 1\)</span> components. Operators in this space are matrices that act on these vectors, either returning the same state with an eigenvalue or producing a mixture of states.</p>
<p>When a rotation is applied to the state, it does not simply adjust to a new projection as in classical vectors. Instead, quantum mechanics dictates that the rotated state becomes a superposition of all possible states:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
R(\theta) |Jm\rangle = \sum_{m'} D^{(J)}_{m'm}(\theta) |Jm'\rangle

<p>For example, consider a spin-1 state initially perpendicular to the <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>-axis and rotated by 30 degrees. The resulting state composition can be determined by looking up these Wigner D coefficients.</p>
<p>To perform a rotation about the <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>-axis, we use the <span class="math inline">\(J_y\)</span> operator, which has zeros on the diagonal and coefficients above and below the diagonal.

D^J_{m'm}(\gamma, \theta, \phi) = e^{-i\gamma m'} d^J_{m'm}(\theta) e^{-i\phi m}
\]</span></p>
<p>The most nontrivial part is the middle rotation about <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, while the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-rotations introduce phase factors.</p>
<p>For a concrete example, take a spin-<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> state <span class="math inline">\(|\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\rangle\)</span> and rotate it by 30 degrees about <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. The resulting state is a superposition:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
R_Y(30^\circ) \left|\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right\rangle = \cos(15^\circ) \left|\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right\rangle + \sin(15^\circ) \left|\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle
\]</span></p>
<p>The coefficients here are derived from the Wigner D matrix for spin-<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>, which takes the form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
D^{1/2}(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) &amp; -\sin(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2) &amp; \cos(\theta/2)
\end{pmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>These coefficients can be found in tables alongside Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, as they are closely related to the <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)\)</span> group structure.</p>

<p>What we have discussed so far does not involve weak or strong interactions. It is purely about rotations and the rotational group. The remarkable part is that understanding particle behavior and angular distributions requires very little input from strong interactions.</p>
<p>Angular distributions are determined by general properties of how space rotates. The only input needed from strong interactions is the preference for which spin states are produced. The decay patterns and kinematic asymmetries, however, are entirely governed by the rotational group.</p>
<p>This is why we can now proceed with a general recipe for analyzing angular distributions, relying primarily on rotational symmetry and minimal assumptions about the underlying interactions.</p>

<p>The book explains how particle definitions are constructed, offering insights into the relationship between helicity states and canonical states. The discussion is rooted in the Lorentz group framework, which is fundamental for understanding particle states in quantum field theory.</p>

<p>I left you an exercise involving Dalitz plots from Kleo and Babar where I removed the labels. The plots correspond to <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D_s\)</span> decays, but the final-state particles are not specified. The axis labels remain, but the masses are hidden.</p>
<p>The goal is to use kinematics to deduce the masses and identify the decays. Each group will analyze one plot and then exchange it for another.</p>

<p>I will give you one homework for your group, and then you can exchange it for another one, including the EP assignment. I have to leave now, but I can give you the homework from my office. Please come with me to collect it. Thanks for coming, and sorry for being slightly late.</p>
<p>Your homework is due tomorrow at 8am in the same auditorium on the second floor. Be there at 8am sharp. I also need someone to handle the water supply—I usually take care of it, but if anyone else wants to volunteer, let me know.</p>
<p>Mauritz, thanks for coming. For those who missed the CERN excursion, it was a lot of fun. We heard about your cheese obsession—apparently, it’s partly true. Everyone was obsessed, and we even discussed the rules for fondue. The 25th of May is the last day for fondue, so we were still within the legal limit.</p>
<p>If you want to work on something before tomorrow, you still have time. However, none of you handed in the last homework. Was it too difficult, or did you just not attend the lectures?</p>

<p>If you don’t handle the problems, just look and appreciate them. It’s important to attend the lectures, especially at the beginning, where we have a recap.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feasibility-of-strong-interaction-studies-in-lattice-qcd">Feasibility of Strong Interaction Studies in Lattice QCD</h2>
<p>The examples shown so far involve weak interactions, but the question is whether similar studies can be done for strong interactions using Lattice QCD.</p>
<p>Currently, Lattice QCD uses a different approach—it can handle isolated scattering of two particles but cannot yet compute densities. For instance, the decay of a <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> meson or <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> meson into three particles is not feasible on the lattice. This is because such processes involve ill-defined questions on the lattice, which primarily works with correlation functions.</p>
<p>However, there is active development in this direction, particularly for three-body kinematics in Lattice QCD. This is a highly researched area, and progress is being made. For a master’s thesis, exploring these topics could be valuable, though they may appear both complicated and conceptually simple at first glance.</p>
<p>John Bulawa is a key researcher in this field and could provide guidance on potential thesis work. The methods and problems in Lattice QCD are evolving, making it an exciting area for new students to contribute.</p>

<p>Replicating complex probes appears complicated and rather simple at the same time. You probe all the points you have, but the implementation is likely very complicated.</p>
<p>For a newcomer, it is feasible to make significant steps in that direction. Even at the master’s level in experimental physics, a thesis could achieve this in about two months of work using experimental data. However, effort is required to ensure correctness and account for corrections due to effects.</p>
<p>On the lattice, such a task would take years, but it would also be a milestone. The feasibility depends on the topic or direction chosen.</p>
