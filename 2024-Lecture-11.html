<p>We need to fix the day and the format for the exam. The date might still be adjusted between the 23rd and 25th.</p>
<p>Do you know who from our group would come or meet to do the exam? We would need to have Marx, Mauritz, and maybe Fibian. I’m not sure if Fibian needs the credit points for this, but I will ask them if they will come.</p>
<p>Paul said he’s finishing his bachelor, so I asked both of them, and I would like others who are available to participate as well. Do you want to participate in the exam? We certainly have to make Dhuvanshu participate.</p>
<p>Durvanshu is a PhD student in our group who was partly involved in the typing exercises. He is at CERN every week doing his hardware job. You might have seen him in the first week—he was here. We should include him in the exam. He skipped the entire semester, so he has to work now.</p>
<p>Did you receive my encouragement to look at the symmetry breaking? I saw it this morning and made some notes on the ideas. Moritz, I briefly saw it yesterday, but I had a dentist appointment because I sent it on Friday. Yesterday was the first working day.</p>
<p>I put a date for Hanin on Thursday. You’re very welcome to bring the information you obtained today and review it again for Ilya’s marketing on Thursday. This is important because it gives you easy points. The exercise is simple, and you might need to report it.</p>
<p>We don’t need to report, but for our number of points over the semester, please collect them. It’s a pity we started a bit late.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mapping-scattering-amplitudes-from-s-plane-to-k-plane">Mapping Scattering Amplitudes from S-Plane to K-Plane</h2>
<p>We have discussed a lot about amplitude, which is a function of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the Mandelstam variable, calculated as <span class="math inline">\((P_1 + P_2)^2\)</span> for the scattering process. This <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is a convenient variable to describe the scattering amplitude, where the partial wave amplitude <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a function of this single variable.</p>
<p>Equivalently, one can consider the breakup momentum variable <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, which represents the momentum carried by each particle. Here, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the squared energy of the system in the center-of-mass frame, while <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the momentum of each particle in the same frame. The relationship between <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is given by the channeling function, and the analytic structure of the amplitude is simpler in terms of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> near the threshold.</p>
<p>Instead of working in the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-plane, where the amplitude is analytic except for a few singularities, we now examine the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane and relate the structures between the two planes. Specifically, we map the following points from the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-plane to the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Points 1 and 2: Resonances located on the second Riemann sheet with respect to the threshold in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.<br>
</li>
<li>Point 3: A pole on the real axis in the first Riemann sheet, corresponding to a bound state.<br>
</li>
<li>Point 4: A virtual state, residing on the unphysical sheet below the threshold.</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal is to understand how these singularities and structures translate when mapped from the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-plane to the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S = 4(K^2 + m^2)

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="understanding-the-mapping-of-real-axis-and-threshold-in-k-plane">Understanding the Mapping of Real Axis and Threshold in K-Plane</h2>
<p>The real axis in the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-plane gets mapped to the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane as well. It is easier to start by mapping the real axis first and then determine the positions of other features relative to it.</p>
<p>The real axis above the threshold corresponds to a physical region, and this physical region is preserved when mapped to the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane. The point where <span class="math inline">\(S = 0\)</span> corresponds to the threshold in the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane. Below the threshold, when <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is smaller than the threshold value, the square root of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> becomes imaginary, meaning <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is also imaginary.</p>
<p>The other square root term (from the breakup momentum function) does not change sign when crossing the threshold. This term remains negative, so it does not introduce any additional complications near the threshold. However, there is a branch point somewhere between zero and the threshold on the real axis in the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane.</p>
<p>The region close to zero in the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane is more complicated due to this branch point, but the focus here is on the behavior near the threshold. The key observation is that the physical region in the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-plane maps directly to the physical region in the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane, while non-physical regions (below threshold) map to imaginary values in the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane.</p>
<p>The mapping simplifies the analysis of scattering amplitudes, particularly near thresholds, by transforming the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-plane structure into a more tractable form in the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane. The relationship between <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S = 4(K^2 + m^2)
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the mass of the particle.

<p>I want to look at the function nearest threshold. What happens is really interesting. If you continue that, you would have another real part—somehow it flips back to the real axis. The dashed line would just come back to the real axis somehow.</p>
<p>Number four is straightforward—we just add the dashed line, so it ends up here. For number three, the negative part of the… my intuition suggested it might need to be there because it’s on another Riemann sheet. We just stay there, but how do you realize that?</p>
<p>The value of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is positive—or rather, real below threshold—but on the other sheet. When you put <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> below threshold here, the sheets are related to the <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> sign. That’s where the sheet comes from. Being on the first sheet means the <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> sign, and being on the second sheet means the <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span> sign.</p>
<p>But also, the square root for <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> matters here because these are sheets for <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. On the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> does not change sign, but the square root changes sign. So <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> here and <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> here are the same, but when you map it, you have either <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span>. This tells you that both sheets get mapped to the same <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane—it’s just <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span>.</p>
<p>Numbers 3 and 4, as well as 2 and 1, are rather easy. Essentially, everything is connected analytically.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="complex-plane-transformations-and-riemann-sheets">Complex Plane Transformations and Riemann Sheets</h2>
<p>The transformations between the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-plane and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane are analytically connected. You can visualize this by drawing lines or curves, such as half-circles, that do not intersect the real axis (the dashed line). The exact shape (circle, bicircle, or deformed curve) does not matter as long as the mapping remains analytic.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane is simply a reparametrization of the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-plane. For momentum space (<span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane), there is no square root because <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> itself is the square root of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. A function with a square root has two Riemann sheets, but when expressed in terms of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, it simplifies to a single-sheeted analytic structure. The two-sheeted nature arises from the <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> sign in front of the square root, which is already embedded in the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane.</p>
<p>The mapping is given by the squaring operation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S = K^2
\]</span></p>
<p>In the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane, a domain transforms under squaring, producing a two-sheeted structure in the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-plane. This explains why the sheets are connected without discontinuity.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The relationship between <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is further clarified by the threshold behavior:</p>

<p>where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the particle mass. This connects the energy variable <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to the breakup momentum <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, revealing the analytic structure near thresholds.</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is below threshold, its value remains real but lies on the second Riemann sheet (corresponding to the <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span> sign). The first sheet corresponds to the <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> sign. Importantly, the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane does not distinguish between sheets—it only reflects the sign change in the square root.</p>
<p>The dashed lines in the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-plane (representing branch cuts) map to specific curves in the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-plane, ensuring analytic continuity.

<p>The fundamental fields and building degrees of freedom in QCD are quarks and gluons. However, one of the important phenomena in QCD is confinement. People began understanding the dynamics of QCD by studying protons, neutrons, and nuclear interactions, which exhibit features of confinement.</p>
<p>For comparison, consider electron-proton scattering or electron-electron scattering, where the electromagnetic coupling constant is small:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{e^2}{4\pi} = \frac{1}{137}
\]</span></p>
<p>This small coupling allows perturbative expansions using Feynman diagrams in QED. However, in QCD, the theory is not in a perturbative regime due to confinement.</p>
<p>The degrees of freedom—quarks and gluons—are confined to small scales, forming composite fields such as mesons. This non-perturbative behavior distinguishes QCD from QED, where perturbation theory is applicable.</p>

<p>The theory relies on composite fields (e.g., mesons) as simpler degrees of freedom.

<p>The potential can only be introduced when considering fields as classical fields rather than quantum fields. For classical fields, the concept of potential is clear: if a particle moves in a potential, it turns back when its energy is below the potential energy. For example, a ball hitting a wall reflects back.</p>
<p>Quantum fields behave differently. There is a probability for the particle to penetrate the potential barrier due to quantum effects. If a particle approaches a wall, the wave function has a tail inside the wall, decaying exponentially. This is a consequence of the quantum nature of the system.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quasi-classical-expansion-and-field-averaging">Quasi-Classical Expansion and Field Averaging</h2>
<p>The wave function has a tail in the wall due to the quantum nature of the system. The relation between particles, quantum fields, and classical fields arises through quasi-classical expansion. In quantum field theory, <span class="math inline">\(\hbar\)</span> is treated as a small parameter (though in natural units, it is set to 1). This parameter appears in the Lagrangian and action, allowing an expansion in powers of <span class="math inline">\(\hbar\)</span>.</p>
<p>The first term in this expansion gives the average value of the fields, which we identify as the classical field. For example, the field <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> can be obtained by performing an <span class="math inline">\(\hbar\)</span>-expansion of the Lagrangian. The leading term yields not the fluctuating quantum field but the classical average value of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> in space.</p>
<p>At this level, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is no longer a function of spacetime coordinates <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (i.e., it does not fluctuate) but is instead a fixed value. We can then study the quasi-classical potential of the theory, which emerges from this approximation.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="potential-sigma-field-and-massless-pions">Potential, Sigma Field, and Massless Pions</h2>
<p>We can analyze the quasi-classical potential of the theory as a function of the sigma field (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>). The potential is visualized in three dimensions, where the x-axis represents the real part of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> and the y-axis represents the imaginary part. These can be treated as two independent fields, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_1\)</span> (real) and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_2\)</span> (imaginary).</p>
<p>The curvature of the potential indicates the mass of the particle. In the current theory, the degrees of freedom that experience binding in the confinement regime are associated with the sigma field, while the unimportant field is integrated out. The key observation is that the degrees of freedom not experiencing binding—those without curvature in the potential—correspond to the pion (<span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>) field.</p>
<p>The vacuum is centered around a non-zero value due to spontaneous symmetry breaking, filling space with a quark condensate represented by the sigma field. On top of this background, there are fluctuations of the massless pion field. This picture illustrates that the vacuum is dominated by the constant sigma field, while the pion fields fluctuate without mass.</p>

<p>The Higgs mechanism gives quarks mass in real life. If quarks were massless, pions (<span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>), kaons (<span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>), and the eta meson (<span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>) would also be massless, forming a massless multiplet.</p>
<p>We previously examined the current symmetry, checking whether the Lagrangian remains invariant under independent rotations of left-handed and right-handed quarks. The QCD Lagrangian has a global <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)\)</span> symmetry when no mass term is present. This symmetry is spontaneously broken when moving to the minimum of the theory.</p>
<p>Introducing independent rotations of the right and left fields corresponds to rotations in the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> field, reflecting the symmetry of the potential. Once the system settles at the minimum, this symmetry is broken—it is a global symmetry. The breaking of this left-right symmetry leads to the appearance of Goldstone bosons, which are pions. These pions are massless in the idealized case.</p>
<p>If the symmetry were larger, the pattern of symmetry breaking would produce additional massless modes. The mass of pions in reality arises from explicit symmetry breaking due to quark masses generated by the Higgs mechanism.</p>

<p>If symmetry is bigger, like <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)\)</span>, we have eight mesons that are massless. And this is two kaons, three pions, and eight etas that disappear to be massless. Now, why are they not massless? Because quarks have mass.</p>
<p>This connects to the Higgs mechanism, as it is the Higgs interaction with fermions that gives them mass through Yukawa couplings. For the current perturbation theory, we just put a mass term explicitly in the Lagrangian.

The vacuum is filled with the Higgs, and particles moving through it acquire mass.</p>
<p>For the chiral perturbation theory, the mass term appears explicitly in the Lagrangian and breaks the symmetry explicitly.</p>

<p>The proton mass is not determined by the bare masses of the quarks but by the energy stored in quark-gluon interactions. In the chiral limit, where quark masses are set to zero, pions and kaons become massless (as they are Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking), but the proton remains massive. This is because the proton’s mass arises from the dynamics of quark-gluon interactions, not from the quark masses themselves.</p>
<p>The proton is composed of three quarks, but unlike pions, it is not a Goldstone boson. Pions are fluctuations of the quark condensate (the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> field), while protons are excitations of this condensate with additional energy stored in their structure. The mass of the proton is thus a manifestation of the strong interaction energy within QCD.</p>

<p>The mass of hadrons (except Goldstone bosons like pions) is determined by the curvature of the QCD potential. Pions move along flat directions of the potential (no curvature, hence massless), while protons and other hadrons correspond to excitations with non-zero curvature, giving them mass.</p>

</div>
<p>The quark-gluon interactions in mesons also exist, but the key difference lies in the nature of their excitations. The quark condensate forms a background, and pions are small fluctuations on this background, whereas protons are more complex excitations with additional energy contributions.</p>
<p>To understand this mathematically, one can examine how the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> field acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation value and how pions emerge as fluctuations along flat directions of the potential.

<p>The theory itself does not have special values for the quark masses. You can tune the masses, increase them, or even set them to zero, and the theory remains largely unchanged. This is especially true for the light quarks (<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>), whose masses are much smaller than the QCD scale of 1 GeV. Introducing small quark masses does not drastically alter the physics.</p>
<p>When quark masses are introduced, they effectively add a linear term to the potential, slightly skewing it. The overall picture remains almost the same, but the minimum on one side becomes more pronounced. In the pion direction, there is now a curvature, making pions slightly massive. The theory, however, remains fundamentally unchanged.</p>

<p>One important quantity often discussed is the ratio of the proton mass to the pion mass, which is primarily determined by QCD interactions and does not change significantly even if quark masses are increased. Computations of properties in lattice QCD are highly dependent on the quark masses used.

Despite this, the essential properties of the theory—such as those of mesons—do not change much.</p>
<p>While details like particle masses and widths do change, the broader characteristics remain stable.

<p>A useful analogy for understanding lattice simulations is to think of a proton placed in a box with periodic boundary conditions. Due to the finite box size and cyclic boundaries, the proton interacts with its mirror images.</p>
<p>Why use periodic boundary conditions? The alternatives, such as hard-wall boundaries where the wave function vanishes at the edges, introduce quantization effects and restrict the wave function’s behavior. Periodic boundary conditions avoid this by allowing the wave function to remain continuous across the box edges.</p>
<p>In quantum field theory, periodic boundary conditions are advantageous because they preserve translational symmetry and avoid artificial quantization of momenta. This is particularly important in lattice QCD, where the wave function should not be forced to zero at the boundaries.</p>

<p>I should have started by saying that one can spend a semester or several semesters learning quantum thermodynamics on the lattice. It’s a rapidly moving field with many interesting techniques, but I can only give you a brief introduction.</p>
<p>Perhaps John Gulava could hold a lecture on this topic next semester. He would be the right person to introduce all the details, as he has deep expertise in this area. For now, let me give you some vague arguments and a taste of the computations, along with common knowledge about finite volume effects.</p>

<p>The lightest degrees of freedom in the theory are the pions. If you place a proton on the lattice, pions appear as the dominant contribution. The proton is addressed, while pions are beautiful particles that emerge as virtual entities. They do not propagate but instead form clouds around the proton. Since they do not travel, they are virtual particles and cannot sample the boundary of the box.</p>
<p>Pions provide the correct scale for understanding suppression effects. Another way to see this is by examining the interactions in the middle image. The potential has the form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(R) \sim -e^{-m_\pi R}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the distance and <span class="math inline">\(m_\pi\)</span> is the pion mass.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lattice-volume-effects-and-discretization">Lattice Volume Effects and Discretization</h2>
<p>The exponential factor provides another argument for understanding finite-volume effects. Once your lattice is large compared to the inverse mass of the pion (<span class="math inline">\(1/m_\pi\)</span>), your computations closely approximate infinite-volume quantities. However, these are still box quantities, meaning the physics is constrained to the box. When the box size <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> becomes infinite, you approach true infinite-volume physics, and the computations reflect the physical situation.</p>
<p>Discretization error is another consideration. The more steps you take in the lattice, the better the approximation. Increasing the volume of the box significantly would make computations more intensive, but the box is never truly empty. Even if no explicit particles are placed inside, the vacuum itself contains fluctuating quantum fields. These fields interact, and the box is filled with correlated fields, visualized as bubbles appearing and disappearing in the vacuum.</p>
<p>Adjusting discretization by varying grid spacing is important. The lattice spacing <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> affects the scales probed in the theory. For large <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, confinement may break down, as the theory loses its non-perturbative properties.

While the computation remains possible, the convergence is poor because of oscillatory behavior, leading to the so-called “time problem.” A complex weight is unsuitable for the emergency fgametric to 5.</p>
<p>To address this, instead of using the Minkowski metric, one performs a transformation of time to imaginary time and adopts the Euclidean metric. For example, when computing the operator correlation function ( <span class="math inline">\(C(t)\)</span> ), the action becomes imaginary, and the integral’s convergence improves significantly when working with real weights.</p>
<p>The Euclidean metric is introduced by replacing time with imaginary time, which effectively transforms the Lagrangian (or action) into a real-valued quantity. This modification enhances the numerical stability and efficiency of the integral evaluation.</p>

<p>The step size in the spectrum is as small as <span class="math inline">\(1/L\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the system size. For a two-particle system, the spectrum is discrete. Consider particles labeled by <span class="math inline">\(M = 1, 2, 3, 4\)</span> in a periodic band configuration.</p>
<p>You can visualize this as two particles moving in a circle of length <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. This is the one-dimensional case of a box with periodic boundary conditions, and the spectrum remains discrete. The total energy of the system is simply the sum of the individual particle energies when they are non-interacting:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E_{\text{system}} = \sum_i E_i
\]</span></p>
<p>However, when interactions are introduced, the energy of the system shifts slightly. The total energy can still be expressed as a sum, but now an interaction term must be included:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E_{\text{system}} = \sum_i E_i + E_{\text{interaction}}
\]</span></p>
<p>This shift in energy levels due to interactions is the key idea behind lattice spectroscopy. By computing the spectrum first without interactions and then with interactions, the differences between energy levels reveal information about the particles, particularly the phase shift induced by their interactions.</p>

<p>We have learned so much about the hadron spectrum from lattice QCD. The lattice provides an isolated setup where there are no experimental effects, allowing us to study processes that are impossible in experiments.

<p>The <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span>-sigma meson system, which appears as a blob in the spectrum, is a candidate for a tetraquark state at low energy. In lattice QCD, we can study <span class="math inline">\(\pi\pi\)</span> scattering by inserting a photon current and computing the correlation function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>This cannot be studied with KVT (Kinematic Vertex Tracking) because it only deals with pure electronic states, where quarks are not directly accessible. Form factors cannot be computed, and there is no straightforward way to fix low-energy constants.
