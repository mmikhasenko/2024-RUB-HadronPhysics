<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-to-lecture-topics-and-decay-analysis"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction to Lecture Topics and Decay Analysis</h2>
<p>We are finishing the lecture cycle with two more to go. Today’s lecture will focus more on physics, while next week I will discuss meta-issues related to how the hadron community functions. I will provide background on research structure, collaborations, and how scientists operate in the hadron physics domain. Next week will have less physics, though I may spend the first 20 minutes reviewing recent discoveries and current experimental progress in the field.</p>
<p>Today, I want to focus on physics, including formulas, and discuss how hadron physics is applied outside its domain. I debated dedicating this lecture to either CP violation, where hadron physics plays a key role, or to <span class="math inline">g-2</span> and hadronic contributions to the muon magnetic moment. I decided on the latter, as it connects to several topics we’ve already covered.</p>
<p>The exercise sheet will now include problems on the <span class="math inline">R</span> ratio, which was previously postponed. We will revisit this at a more advanced level, incorporating the knowledge we’ve gained.</p>
<p>To start today’s lecture, I will briefly recap our earlier discussion on helicity and chirality, specifically examining the decay of the <span class="math inline">\pi^{+}</span> meson:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{align}
\pi^{+} &amp;\longrightarrow \mu^{+}\,\nu_{\mu}\,, \\
\pi^{+} &amp;\longrightarrow e^{+}\,\nu_{e}
\end{align}
</span></p>
<p>These decays illustrate key concepts in weak interactions and lepton universality. Comparing these processes will help us understand the underlying physics.</p>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chirality-and-spin-configurations-in-pion-decay"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Chirality and Spin Configurations in Pion Decay</h2>
<p>The ratio of matrix elements for pion decay into electrons versus muons is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\frac{m_{e}}{E}&lt;\frac{m_{\mu}}{E}\;\Longrightarrow\;  
\frac{|\mathcal{M}_{e}|^{2}}{|\mathcal{M}_{\mu}|^{2}}\ll1
</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">m_e</span> and <span class="math inline">m_\mu</span> are the masses of the electron and muon, respectively, while <span class="math inline">E</span> is the energy scale of the decay. The inequality shows that the electron channel is suppressed compared to the muon channel due to the smaller mass of the electron.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Chirality is directly related to spin orientation in the high-mass limit, which is why we can clearly observe chiral properties in the decay products.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The weak interaction vertex ( <span class="math inline">V-A</span> ) produces particles in their chiral configurations. For example, the <span class="math inline">W</span> boson decay produces a left-handed electron and a left-handed neutrino. Since the neutrino is massless, it is purely left-handed, while the electron has both left and right components, with the right component suppressed by <span class="math inline">m_e / E</span>.</p>
<p>In the center-of-momentum frame, the spins of the decay products must sum to the spin of the pion ( <span class="math inline">J = 0</span> ). For the electron and neutrino, their spins are <span class="math inline">1/2</span>, and they must be back-to-back to conserve angular momentum. However, flipping the spin of the right-handed electron is allowed but suppressed by <span class="math inline">m_e / E</span>, whereas the neutrino cannot be flipped due to its zero mass.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The suppression factor differs for electrons and muons because <span class="math inline">m_e \ll m_\mu</span>. For the pion decay into muons, the muon is nearly non-relativistic, so the chirality suppression is less pronounced.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The matrix elements for <span class="math inline">\pi^+ \to e^+ \nu_e</span> and <span class="math inline">\pi^+ \to \mu^+ \nu_\mu</span> are thus differently suppressed, with the electron channel being heavily suppressed due to its small mass. This explains why the pion predominantly decays into muons rather than electrons.</p>

<section id="phase-space-and-energy-release-in-pion-decay" class="level2" data-number="3">
<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="phase-space-and-energy-release-in-pion-decay"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Phase Space and Energy Release in Pion Decay</h2>
<p>The expression for the phase space ratio in pion decay is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">  
\frac{\Phi(\,e^{+}\nu_{e})}{\Phi(\,\mu^{+}\nu_{\mu})} = \frac{s-m_{e}^{2}}{s-m_{\mu}^{2}} &gt; 1  
</span></p>
<p>However, this does not fully explain the observed decay rates. The correct answer is that the ratio is significantly less than one, which is why pions decay predominantly to muons rather than electrons.</p>
<p>Phase space represents the number of possible configurations in the decay. For two-body decays, it is determined by angular configurations, but there is also an energy-dependent factor. The larger the energy release, the larger the phase space.</p>
<p>For the muon decay channel, the initial energy is given by the pion mass, and the final state includes particles with their own masses. The energy release is the difference between these masses. In the electron channel, the mass difference is small, so the energy release is tiny. In contrast, for the muon channel, most of the energy goes into kinetic energy because the neutrino is nearly massless.</p>

<p>$$ ## Magnetic Moment of the Muon and Quantum Corrections</p>
<p>Because the pion is massless and the electron is almost massless, the phase space is much larger. For the second case, however, this does not compensate the suppression. Let’s consider the phase space of the electron channel. There is an angle integral which I’m going to implement now, and the neutrino phase space is something like that. The breakup momentum is something I need to evaluate, and I will double-check the calculation.</p>
<p>The challenge function is the mass of the pion, and another channel function is zero. The chaining function is <span class="math inline">xyz</span>, so it would be <span class="math inline">x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2 \Delta E</span>. Once I drop the terms <span class="math inline">x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2x^2 - 2yz - 2zx</span>, and then if <span class="math inline">b = 0</span>, this term is dropped. The remaining expression is just the difference, which is a full square. I then substitute <span class="math inline">(s - m_e^2) / (s - m_\mu^2)</span>. This full square is dropped because of the <span class="math inline">1/2</span> factor, and this is the answer.</p>
<p>This node does not compensate the suppression, so the dominant decay of the pion is the muon channel. It’s important to realize the steps we’ve taken because this is a nice piece of physics. It explains how parity violation was discovered—by observing that the muon is the predominant decay product. For this vertex to be <span class="math inline">V - A</span> weak interaction, you need this term to violate parity.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact is that in this decay, the muon is produced polarized. The pion doesn’t carry spin, and the neutrino is not detected—it just flies away. The muon, however, is produced polarized. In 1967, an experiment confirmed this. What’s remarkable about the muon is that it is self-analyzing. Its decay to an electron, neutrino, and antineutrino has an angular distribution of electrons that indicates the muon’s polarization.</p>
<p>This is a very elegant setup. You can analyze the vertex here, which has a <span class="math inline">V - A</span> current that violates parity. The axial term <span class="math inline">\gamma_5</span> would violate parity, and you can check this easily. The second decay, the muon decay, produces a charged track. The angular distribution of this track in the muon’s rest frame tells you whether the muon is polarized.</p>
<p>If the muon is not polarized, the electron directions are equally probable in the helicity frame. But if it is polarized, the forward direction is preferred—aligned with the spin. The muon carries its spin as it flies, and in its rest frame, you only have spin information. This is called the KTG frame. In this frame, the electron preferentially moves in a certain direction, though it can go anywhere—just with different probabilities.</p>
<p>Integrating over the electron energies reveals that this is the preferred configuration, even for a linearly polarized muon beam. Shortly after, the same technique was used to measure something more fundamental: the magnetic moment of the muon.</p>
<p>We discussed this in the second lecture when we calculated the quark content of the proton’s magnetic moment. Let me remind you what it is. The magnetic moment of a particle describes its interaction with a magnetic field. For a point-like fermion, it is given by the Bohr magneton and the gyromagnetic factor:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\vec{\mu} = \frac{e}{2m} g \vec{S}, \quad g = 2 \ \text{(Dirac, pointlike)}
</span></p>
<p>This is a fundamental quantity, and <span class="math inline">g = 2</span> for a fermion. However, for the proton, we found <span class="math inline">g \approx 2.8</span>. How can this be if the proton is a fermion? This discrepancy indicates that the proton is not pointlike—it is made of quarks.</p>
<p>In the quark model, we computed the correct value by considering the charges and masses of the constituent quarks. For the proton, the charge <span class="math inline">e</span> is <span class="math inline">+1</span>, but for quarks, it is fractional. The masses are taken as constituent quark masses, around 0.3 GeV for up and down quarks.</p>
<p>For the muon, however, we do not doubt that it is an elementary particle with no internal structure. We expect <span class="math inline">g = 2</span>, but this is only true at first order. There are corrections from virtual processes that make <span class="math inline">g</span> not exactly 2. The quantity <span class="math inline">a = (g - 2)/2</span> is used to describe these corrections.</p>
<p>The muon’s <span class="math inline">g - 2</span> is one of the most precisely known numbers in physics. It is a key test of quantum field theory and may hint at new physics if discrepancies with theory are found. $$</p>

<p>Now, we can start including morphologies like the three- or four-crossing processes. All possible processes are calculated to a fixed order by counting vertices. For example, here we have two vertices, giving the first-order correction.</p>

<p>The numerical value in parentheses indicates uncertainty in the last digits. The series converges, and modern calculations rely on numerical techniques rather than manual diagram evaluations, as done by Schwinger. For higher-order corrections (e.g., fifth order), millions of terms must be computed, but the muon mass can often be neglected to simplify loop integrals.</p>
<p>The first-order correction was derived in the 1770s, and Schwinger later calculated the <span class="math inline">\alpha/2\pi</span> term, a foundational result for QED. The experimental measurement of <span class="math inline">g-2</span> uses the decay chain <span class="math inline">\pi \to \mu \to e + \nu_\mu + \nu_e</span>. The setup, proposed decades ago, involves a storage ring with a 20-meter radius, similar to Brookhaven National Lab’s experiment.</p>
<p>Muons are trapped in the ring under a magnetic field, causing them to travel in circular orbits due to the bending force.

<p>$$ ## Hadronic Contributions to Anomalous Magnetic Moment</p>
<p>The spin precession frequency <span class="math inline">\omega_s</span> is measured in experiments like the muon <span class="math inline">g-2</span> experiment. If the spin points outwards, there is a loss of detected electrons, while if it points inwards, more electrons are observed. This creates fluctuations in the energy deposit along the circular path.</p>
<p>In the <span class="math inline">g-2</span> measurement setup, the digital flow shows time on the x-axis and a signal related to energy deposit. The frequency of rotation remains constant because it is determined by the charge of the electron. Over time, muons in the batch decay, causing the overall energy deposit to decrease exponentially. However, this decay is modulated by spin rotation fluctuations.</p>
<p>The analysis is blinded, meaning the true frequency is hidden until the final results are revealed. For instance, in a recent press release, the analysts wrote down the real frequency on a piece of paper in an envelope beforehand. During the press conference, the envelope was opened, and the true frequency was entered to unblind the results.</p>
<p>The experiment measures <span class="math inline">\omega_s</span>, but the key observable is the difference between <span class="math inline">\omega_s</span> and the cyclotron frequency <span class="math inline">\omega_c</span>. If these frequencies were identical, the spin configuration would propagate uniformly, and no fluctuations would be observed. The experiment’s sensitivity comes from this difference.</p>
<p>Muons are naturally polarized when produced in pion decays due to the weak interaction vertex, which enforces a specific chirality. This polarization is crucial for the experiment. The next-generation experiment is currently underway, with the primary challenge being the homogeneity of the magnetic field. Even slight inhomogeneities introduce uncertainties because the integral of the magnetic field experienced by the muon varies.</p>
<p>The precision of the experiment is quantified in parts per billion (ppb). The current experimental uncertainty is 63 ppb, while the theoretical prediction is around 100 ppb.</p>
<p>The hadronic contributions to the muon’s anomalous magnetic moment are significant. Beyond QED corrections, there are electroweak and hadronic effects. Two prominent hadronic contributions are:</p>
<p>1.<strong>Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP)</strong>: A photon produces hadrons, which then recombine into a photon. This is represented by the diagram where a photon splits into hadrons and reforms.<br>
2. <strong>Hadronic Light-by-Light (HLbL) Scattering</strong>: This involves photons interacting via intermediate hadrons. The process can be visualized as light entering and exiting a hadronic blob, with intermediate hadron states like <span class="math inline">\pi^0</span> or <span class="math inline">\eta</span> mesons, which decay into two photons.</p>
<p>The quantum numbers (<span class="math inline">J^{PC}</span>) of the intermediate hadrons must match those of the photon for the process to occur.<br>

<p>The dispersion relation is a consequence of the Cauchy theorem, and it provides a useful representation for functions with specific analytic properties.

<p>This function allows us to recover the full function from its imaginary part. It tells us what the function is equal to here, and using this relation, we can determine it anywhere in the complex plane.</p>
<p>This is an advanced subject in dispersion relations, but it’s part of the coursework. It’s a little exercise that helps you understand better how dispersion works. The key concept here is <strong>subtraction</strong>.</p>
<p>When people say they perform this dispersion relation with one subtraction, it means two poles are introduced. The integral involves the variable <span class="math inline">s'</span>, and the term <span class="math inline">s - a</span> appears outside the integral. This term vanishes when <span class="math inline">s = a</span>, so to maintain the correct relation, we include <span class="math inline">g(a)</span> explicitly.</p>
<p>This is called a <strong>one-subtracted dispersion relation</strong>. The simplest subtraction occurs at <span class="math inline">a = 0</span>, giving:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
g(s) = g(0) + \frac{s}{\pi} \int_{s_{\text{th}}}^{\infty} \frac{\operatorname{Im}g(s')}{s'(s'-s)} \, ds'
</span></p>
<p>Here, the extra <span class="math inline">s</span> in the denominator comes from the subtraction. This is necessary when the function does not decrease fast enough at infinity. In such cases, you must use a one-subtracted or even a twice-subtracted relation.</p>
<p>For a twice-subtracted dispersion relation, the term <span class="math inline">(s - a)</span> is raised to the second power, modifying the integral further.</p>

<p>Subtractions are essential when the function’s high-energy behavior does not satisfy the conditions for an unsubtracted dispersion relation. They allow us to still reconstruct the function using its imaginary part, even when it decays too slowly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This method is widely used in physics, particularly in scattering amplitude analysis, where discontinuities across cuts correspond to physical thresholds.</p>

<p>$$ ## R Ratio and Resonances in Experimental Measurements</p>
<p>The R ratio is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
R(s) = \frac{\sigma(e^{+}e^{-}\!\to\!\text{hadrons})}{\sigma_{0}(e^{+}e^{-}\!\to\!\mu^{+}\mu^{-})}
</span></p>
<p>The function is real up to the threshold, and this implies a specific relation. When the function is real in the vicinity and we approach the threshold, the imaginary part appears with opposite signs on either side of the cut. This is how analyticity introduces the imaginary part consistently from both sides of the cut.</p>
<p>For example, consider the function <span class="math inline">X</span> where:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
X - X = \int \frac{X}{5}
</span></p>
<p>The imaginary part of <span class="math inline">\sqrt{X(1 - X)}</span> can be evaluated explicitly, and we must also include the value at zero, which is one. This may seem surprising, but it works mathematically because we started with an analytic function.</p>
<p>The imaginary part of the square root is hyperscaling, so we can express it as a real mathematical relation. Now, we relate the imaginary part of this block to the cross section through the optical theorem. The cross section is the observable, and it corresponds to the imaginary part.</p>
<p>The R ratio’s denominator is the theoretical cross section for <span class="math inline">e^{+}e^{-}\!\to\!\mu^{+}\mu^{-}</span>, which is not directly measured in experiments but is very close to what we observe. The exercise sheet highlights the small differences between theory and experiment.</p>
<p>The R ratio reveals all the resonances that can appear, such as the <span class="math inline">\rho</span>, <span class="math inline">\phi</span>, and <span class="math inline">\Upsilon</span>. These resonances sit on a background of hadronic contributions, which include quark production and subsequent hadronization into multiple pions or other particles.</p>

<p>The R ratio is a key observable because it captures both resonant and non-resonant (background) contributions, providing a comprehensive view of the hadronic cross section in electron-positron collisions.</p>

<p>We are finishing the lecture cycle, with two more lectures remaining. Today’s lecture will focus more on physics, while next week will cover meta-issues and how the hadron community functions. I will provide background on research structure, collaborations, and how scientists operate in the hadron physics domain. Next week will have less physics, though I may spend the first 20 minutes reviewing recent discoveries and current experimental progress in the hadron physics community.</p>
<p>Today, I will discuss how hadron physics is used outside its direct domain, particularly its role in other studies. I considered dedicating this lecture to either CP violation, where hadron physics plays a key role, or to the <span class="math inline">g-2</span> (muon magnetic moment) and its hadronic contributions. I decided to focus on the latter, as it connects to several topics we’ve already discussed.</p>
<p>The exercise sheet will cover the <span class="math inline">R</span>-ratio, which was originally planned for earlier lectures but was postponed. Now, we will revisit it at a more advanced level, incorporating additional problems and applying the knowledge we’ve gained.</p>
<p>To begin today’s lecture, I will briefly recap a previous discussion on helicity and chirality, specifically examining the decay of the <span class="math inline">\pi^+</span> meson:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{align}
\pi^{+} &amp;\longrightarrow \mu^{+}\,\nu_{\mu}\,, \\
\pi^{+} &amp;\longrightarrow e^{+}\,\nu_{e}\,.

<p>We will compare the decays involving a neutrino. Start by drawing the two-body decay in the thrust frame of the decaying particle, indicating momenta and chirality. The vertex here corresponds to a weak interaction, meaning the produced particles inherit chiral properties (left- or right-handed).</p>
<p>Since chirality relates to spin orientation in the high-mass limit, the diagram will clearly display this property. From these chiral configurations, estimate the ratio of the matrix elements for the first and second cases. Consider which phase space is larger — the first or the second — and determine which decay is more probable for the particle <span class="math inline">P</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss the first case: the decay <span class="math inline">\pi^+ \to \mu^+ \nu_\mu</span> compared to <span class="math inline">\pi^+ \to e^+ \nu_e</span>. The weak interaction governs these processes, and chirality plays a key role in the matrix elements. The phase space difference arises due to the lepton masses, affecting the decay rates.</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{align}
\pi^{+} &amp;\longrightarrow \mu^{+}\,\nu_{\mu}\,, \\
\pi^{+} &amp;\longrightarrow e^{+}\,\nu_{e}\,.

<p>The heavier muon suppresses its phase space relative to the electron, making the electronic decay less likely despite the larger available energy. This is a direct consequence of the chiral structure in weak interactions.</p>

<h2 data-number="14" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chirality-and-spin-configurations-in-pion-decay-1"><span class="header-section-number">14</span> Chirality and Spin Configurations in Pion Decay</h2>
<p>Let’s discuss the first point. The kinematics indicate chirality in the center-of-momentum decay frame. The neutrino is produced as a particle (not an antineutrino) because the electron comes with its antiparticle.</p>
<p>The weak interaction vertex involves a <span class="math inline">V - A</span> structure, represented by <span class="math inline">\gamma^\mu (1 - \gamma^5)</span>. This projects the quark current into left-handed (LH) and right-handed (RH) components. For example, a term like <span class="math inline">\bar{u} \gamma^\mu (1 - \gamma^5) u</span> ensures the quark is left-handed and the antiquark is right-handed.</p>
<p>In pion decay, the <span class="math inline">W</span> boson vertex produces the final-state particles in their chiral configurations:</p>
<p>-The positron (<span class="math inline">e^+</span>) is right-handed.<br>
- The electron (<span class="math inline">e^-</span>) would be left-handed.<br>
- The neutrino (<span class="math inline">\nu_e</span>) is purely left-handed because it is massless.</p>
<p>For a right-handed particle, the spin component aligned with momentum is dominant. For a left-handed particle, the opposite is true. In the center-of-momentum frame, the spins of the produced particles (e.g., <span class="math inline">e^+</span> and <span class="math inline">\nu_e</span>) are both <span class="math inline">1/2</span>, leading to a back-to-back configuration. The total spin sum must match the pion’s spin (<span class="math inline">0</span>), so certain spin configurations are forbidden or suppressed.</p>
<p>The neutrino, being massless, has no right-handed component. However, the electron can have a suppressed right-handed component proportional to <span class="math inline">m_e / E</span>. This suppression is stronger for the electron than for the muon due to their mass difference:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\frac{m_e}{E} \ll \frac{m_\mu}{E} \implies \frac{|\mathcal{M}_e|^2}{|\mathcal{M}_\mu|^2} \ll 1
</span></p>
<p>For the pion decay <span class="math inline">\pi^+ \to \mu^+ \nu_\mu</span>, the muon is nearly non-relativistic because the pion mass is only slightly larger than the muon mass. Thus, the chirality suppression is less severe compared to the electronic decay <span class="math inline">\pi^+ \to e^+ \nu_e</span>, where the electron is highly relativistic and the suppression is stronger.</p>

<h2 data-number="15" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="phase-space-and-energy-release-in-pion-decay-1"><span class="header-section-number">15</span> Phase Space and Energy Release in Pion Decay</h2>
<p>The expression for the phase space ratio in pion decay is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\frac{\Phi(\,e^{+}\nu_{e})}{\Phi(\,\mu^{+}\nu_{\mu})} = \frac{s-m_{e}^{2}}{s-m_{\mu}^{2}} &gt; 1
</span></p>
<p>However, this ratio is not as strong as it might appear. The correct answer is that the ratio is significantly less than one. This explains why the pion decays predominantly to a muon and neutrino rather than an electron and neutrino.</p>
<p>The phase space represents the number of kinematic configurations available in the decay. For two-body decays, it reduces to angular configurations, which are the same for both cases. But there is also an energy-dependent factor, which determines how much energy is released in the decay.</p>
<p>The energy release is larger when the mass difference between the initial and final states is greater. For the pion decay:</p>
<p>-The initial energy is given by the pion mass.<br>
- The final-state particles (e.g., <span class="math inline">\mu^+ \nu_\mu</span> or <span class="math inline">e^+ \nu_e</span>) carry their own masses.</p>
<p>In the case of <span class="math inline">\pi^+ \to e^+ \nu_e</span>, the energy release is tiny because the electron mass is negligible, and most of the energy goes into kinetic energy. For <span class="math inline">\pi^+ \to \mu^+ \nu_\mu</span>, the muon mass is much larger, so the energy release is smaller in comparison. This difference in phase space favors the muonic decay.</p>

<p>Because the pion is massless (or nearly massless for the electron case), the phase space is much larger for the electron decay channel. However, this does not compensate for the suppression in the second case.</p>
<p>For the phase space of the electron channel, we evaluate the breakup momentum and include an angle integral. The breakup momentum can be expressed in terms of the squared invariant mass <span class="math inline">s</span> and the particle masses. The challenge function is constructed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
f(s, m_{e}) = s - m_{e}^2
</span></p>
<p>For another channel, the function would be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
f(s, m_{\mu}) = s - m_{\mu}^2
</span></p>
<p>The full expression involves terms like <span class="math inline">x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2xy - 2yz - 2zx</span>, but when <span class="math inline">b = 0</span>, certain terms drop out, leaving only the difference in energies. The final phase space ratio is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\frac{\Phi(e^{+}\nu_{e})}{\Phi(\mu^{+}\nu_{\mu})} = \frac{s - m_{e}^2}{s - m_{\mu}^2}
</span></p>
<p>This ratio does not compensate for the suppression, so the dominant decay of the pion is to a muon and neutrino.</p>

<p>The parity-violating nature of the weak interaction ( <span class="math inline">V - A</span> structure) is crucial here. The axial ( <span class="math inline">A</span> ) term violates parity, which is why the pion predominantly decays to a muon rather than an electron.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another key observation is that the muon produced in pion decay is polarized. Since the pion is spinless, the decay products (muon and neutrino) must conserve angular momentum. The neutrino is not directly detectable, but the muon’s polarization can be inferred from its subsequent decay:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\mu^+ \to e^+ \nu_e \bar{\nu}_{\mu}
</span></p>
<p>The muon is “self-analyzing” because the angular distribution of the emitted electron in the muon’s rest frame reflects its polarization.

<p>In the helicity frame of the muon, if the muon is polarized, the electron is more likely to be emitted in the forward direction (aligned with the spin). This asymmetry is a direct consequence of parity violation.</p>

<p>The series is converging, and we now rely on numerical techniques. No one computes these diagrams by hand anymore, as Schwinger did. Instead, you set up the computer. For fifth-order calculations, there are likely millions of terms to evaluate, and all loop integrals are interrelated.</p>

<p>The mass of the muon can often be neglected in these calculations, simplifying the process.</p>

<p>The first-order calculations date back to the 1770s. Schwinger’s foundational work introduced the fine-structure constant <span class="math inline">\alpha</span> with his famous result:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
a_e = \frac{\alpha}{2\pi}

<p>The cyclotron frequency <span class="math inline">\omega_c</span> is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\omega_{c}=\frac{eB}{m\gamma}
</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">e</span> is the muon charge, <span class="math inline">B</span> is the magnetic field, <span class="math inline">m</span> is the muon mass, and <span class="math inline">\gamma</span> is the Lorentz factor.</p>
<p>The experimental setup involves pions decaying to muons, which then decay to electrons and neutrinos. This setup was proposed decades ago and is still used today. The muons are trapped in a ring with a magnetic field, causing them to travel in circular orbits due to the bending force. The ring has a radius of 20 meters, similar to the setup at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL).</p>
<p>In the magnetic field, the muon spin precesses. The difference between the cyclotron frequency <span class="math inline">\omega_c</span> and the spin precession frequency <span class="math inline">\omega_s</span> is proportional to the anomalous magnetic moment <span class="math inline">a_\mu</span> (the “g-2” term). This relationship allows the experiment to measure the deviation from the Dirac value.</p>
<p>The experiment begins with a proton beam hitting a target to produce pions. These pions are directed into a decay tunnel, where some decay into muons. The muons are then trapped in the storage ring. The precession of the muon spin is observed, and the tilt in the spin direction after one orbit is proportional to <span class="math inline">a_\mu</span>.</p>

<p>Pions decay into muons, which are polarized and trapped in the ring. Since the pions produce muons with aligned spins, the initial configuration is already ideal for measurement. The muon spin precesses in the magnetic field as the muon moves along the circular path.</p>
<p>The spin orientation is measured by detecting the decay electrons. Muons in the bunch (millions of particles) decay over time, and the resulting electrons are observed. The setup includes lead glass calorimeters inside the ring. These calorimeters are transparent blocks doped with lead to increase the material’s atomic number (<span class="math inline">Z</span>). When particles enter, they deposit all their energy, which is then collected by photosensors.</p>
<p>The electron flux measured by the calorimeters indicates the spin direction: if the spin points outward, fewer electrons are detected.</p>

<p><span class="math display">
G(s + i0) = G^*(s - i0)
</span></p>
<p>This means the real parts are equal, and the imaginary parts differ by a sign. To illustrate, take the example of <span class="math inline">G(x) = \sqrt{1 - x}</span>, which has a cut starting at <span class="math inline">x = 1</span>. For <span class="math inline">x &lt; 1</span>, the function is real and analytic. For <span class="math inline">x &gt; 1</span>, we evaluate:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
G(x + i0) = \sqrt{-(x - 1) - i0} = i \sqrt{x - 1}
</span> <span class="math display">
G(x - i0) = -i \sqrt{x - 1}
</span></p>
<p>This confirms the relation <span class="math inline">G(s + i0) = G^*(s - i0)</span>.</p>
<p>Using this, we can rewrite the contour integral. The contribution from the cut reduces to an integral over the discontinuity of <span class="math inline">G(s)</span> across the cut:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
G(s) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \left( \int_{\text{cut}} \frac{G(s_1 + i0) - G(s_1 - i0)}{s_1 - s} \, ds_1 + \text{circle contribution} \right)
</span></p>
<p>The discontinuity is <span class="math inline">2i \operatorname{Im} G(s_1 + i0)</span>, so:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
G(s) = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{s_{\text{th}}}^{\infty} \frac{\operatorname{Im} G(s_1 + i0)}{s_1 - s} \, ds_1 + \text{circle term}
</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">G(s)</span> decays sufficiently fast as <span class="math inline">|s| \to \infty</span>, the circle contribution vanishes, leaving only the dispersion integral. This is the dispersion relation, which allows us to reconstruct the full function from its imaginary part.</p>

<h2 data-number="34" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="understanding-subtraction-in-dispersion-relations-1"><span class="header-section-number">34</span> Understanding Subtraction in Dispersion Relations</h2>
<p>This function allows us to recover the full function from its imaginary part. It’s quite amazing—it tells us what the function is equal to here, and using this relation, we can determine it anywhere in the complex plane.</p>
<p>This is an advanced subject in dispersion relations, but it’s part of the coursework. It’s a little exercise that helps you understand better how dispersion works. The key concept here is <strong>subtraction</strong>.</p>
<p>When people say they use the dispersion relation with one subtraction, it’s not just one subtraction—two poles are introduced. The integral involves <span class="math inline">s'</span> (the integration variable), and <span class="math inline">s - a</span> appears outside the integral. This term vanishes when <span class="math inline">s = a</span>, so to maintain the correct relation, we include <span class="math inline">g(a)</span> here. This is called the <strong>one-subtracted dispersion relation</strong>.</p>
<p>The simplest subtraction occurs at <span class="math inline">a = 0</span>. Then, the relation becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
g(s) = g(0) + \frac{s}{\pi} \int_{s_{\text{th}}}^{\infty} \frac{\operatorname{Im}g(s')}{s'(s' - s)} \, ds'
</span></p>
<p>This extra <span class="math inline">s</span> in the denominator is necessary when the function does not decrease fast enough at high energies. In such cases, you must use a one-subtracted or even a twice-subtracted relation. The twice-subtracted form involves raising <span class="math inline">(s - a)</span> to the second power.</p>

<h2 data-number="35" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analyticity-and-imaginary-parts-in-function-behavior"><span class="header-section-number">35</span> Analyticity and Imaginary Parts in Function Behavior</h2>
<p>The twice-subtracted relation involves raising <span class="math inline">(s - a)</span> to the second power and incorporating it into the formulation. This works surprisingly well, even for functions like the square root of <span class="math inline">x</span>.</p>
<p>When discussing real analyticity, we mean the function is real for real inputs up to a certain threshold. This property implies specific relations for the function’s behavior.</p>
<p>A key observation is that when a function is real in a certain region, the imaginary part must appear consistently across a branch cut. Specifically, if the function is real on one side of the cut, the imaginary part will emerge with opposite signs on either side of the cut. This is a consequence of analyticity — the imaginary part cannot appear arbitrarily but must follow this symmetry.</p>
<p>For example, consider a function that is real along the real axis. As we approach the branch cut, the imaginary part will manifest with a positive sign on one side and a negative sign on the other. This ensures the function remains analytic across the cut.</p>
<p>The subtraction method in dispersion relations helps recover the full function from its imaginary part, maintaining consistency in the complex plane.</p>
<p><span class="math display">
g(s) = g(0) + \frac{s}{\pi} \int_{s_{\text{th}}}^{\infty} \frac{\operatorname{Im}g(s')}{s'(s' - s)} \, ds'
</span></p>
<p>This relation is essential when the function does not decay sufficiently at high energies, requiring one or even two subtractions to ensure convergence.</p>

<h2 data-number="36" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analytic-functions-and-dispersion-relations"><span class="header-section-number">36</span> Analytic Functions and Dispersion Relations</h2>
<p>The function minus <span class="math inline">X</span> is equal to the integral of <span class="math inline">X</span> over 5. The imaginary part of this expression corresponds to the imaginary part of <span class="math inline">\sqrt{X_1 - X}</span>.</p>
<p>We must also include the value at zero, which is non-trivial. This behavior arises because we started with an analytic function. By performing a contour integral, we can evaluate this explicitly. The imaginary part of the square root simplifies to a hypergeometric scale, yielding a real mathematical expression that may seem surprising but holds rigorously.</p>
<p>Now, let’s return to the main expression. We relate the imaginary part of this block (through the optical theorem) to the cross section. Observables are given by the cross section, which is the imaginary part. This imaginary part is placed in the numerator, and we perform a dispersive integral to obtain the contribution.</p>
<p>This explains why we start at the threshold: the function is real below the threshold and only develops an imaginary part beyond it. The polarization is computed via dispersion relations and then linked to the cross section.</p>
<p><span class="math display">
g(s) = g(0) + \frac{s}{\pi} \int_{s_{\text{th}}}^{\infty} \frac{\operatorname{Im}g(s')}{s'(s' - s)} \, ds'
</span></p>
<p>This dispersion relation is crucial when the function does not decay sufficiently at high energies, requiring subtractions for convergence. The function’s analyticity ensures that the imaginary part appears with opposite signs across the branch cut, preserving consistency in the complex plane.</p>

<p>The R ratio is defined with the denominator being the muon pair production cross section (<span class="math inline">\mu^+\mu^-</span>) calculated theoretically. Although this is not an experimental measurement, it is very close to what is observed in experiments. The exercise sheet highlights minor differences between theory and experiment.</p>
<p>The R ratio reveals all resonances that can appear. For example, the plot of experimental measurements shows contributions from resonances like the <span class="math inline">\rho</span>, <span class="math inline">\phi</span>, and <span class="math inline">\Upsilon</span>, as well as a background from hadronic contributions. This background arises from quark production and subsequent hadronization into multi-pion states (not just single or double pions).</p>
<p>The current theoretical calculations for this process align closely with experimental results, but the R ratio remains a powerful tool for studying resonance phenomena.</p>
<p><span class="math display">
R = \frac{\sigma(e^+e^- \to \text{hadrons})}{\sigma(e^+e^- \to \mu^+\mu^-)}
</span></p>
<p>The background in the R ratio reflects the non-resonant hadronic activity, which must be accounted for when interpreting the data. The resonances sit on top of this continuum, making the R ratio a rich observable for studying QCD dynamics.</p>

<p>The current status of the problem is that there is about a five sigma mismatch between theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. This discrepancy has persisted for the last two to three years. Previously, the mismatch was more significant before some issues in the calculations were identified.</p>
<p>This gap was initially interpreted as an indication of new physics. For example, if you calculate a value of 60 parts per billion in theory and measure 60 parts per billion experimentally, but then calculate 100 parts per billion using a different theoretical technique, the five sigma gap between these results becomes apparent.</p>
<p>In later years, two works challenged this potential new physics discovery. The first was a lattice calculation on hadronic vacuum polarization.</p>

<p>Lattice calculations evaluate hadronic vacuum polarization, but they only compute part of the quantity because they operate in the time domain rather than the space domain where <span class="math inline">Q^2</span> is defined. The two domains are interrelated, and lattice methods calculate the portion of this quantity that is theoretically accessible. However, they disagree with phenomenological calculations using dispersion relations, which raises questions about the technique.</p>
<p>This discrepancy is not purely theoretical; it involves experimental input, such as the <span class="math inline">R</span>-ratio, which has significant uncertainties. Currently, the disagreement is attributed to the region between <span class="math inline">\rho</span> and <span class="math inline">\phi</span> mesons, where experimental data are sparse.</p>
<p>Recent lattice data show the discrepancy shrinking from 5<span class="math inline">\sigma</span> to 1.8<span class="math inline">\sigma</span>. A publication from the CMD-3 experiment in Novosibirsk claims new measurements in the fine <span class="math inline">\rho</span> region are inconsistent with past experiments but align with theoretical predictions for the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to <span class="math inline">(g-2)_\mu</span>.</p>
