The transition occurs when the Higgs field develops a non-zero vacuum expectation value (vev), filling space with a condensate. Particles moving through this condensate “slow down,” acquiring mass.\nThe evolution of the Higgs potential is described by spontaneous symmetry breaking, where the potential shifts from a symmetric state to a preferred minimum. The Higgs potential can be visualized as:\n\nV(\\phi) = \\mu^2 |\\phi|^2 + \\lambda |\\phi|^4\n\nHere, \\phi is the Higgs field, \\mu^2 determines the shape of the potential, and \\lambda is the self-coupling constant. When \\mu^2 &lt; 0, the potential develops a non-zero vev, breaking electroweak symmetry.\nThis marks the electroweak epoch, where the universe transitions from a symmetric phase to one where particles gain mass and the fundamental forces separate."

Hydrogen formation occurred extremely quickly — within 10^{-12} seconds after the electroweak epoch (10^{-36} seconds), followed by the QCD phase transition at 10^{-6} seconds, and then the hadronization process by 1 second.\nTo put this into perspective, the time between a clap and hearing the sound (~10 milliseconds) is vastly longer than the timescale of these early universe processes. The rest of the universe’s history (billions of years) involves less intense physics from the perspective of hadron dynamics.\nHadrons are objects where strong interactions are confined to a scale of a few femtometers (1 \\ \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\ \\text{m}). Within this tiny volume, quarks and gluons interact, surrounded by mostly empty space. This is the smallest natural scale where strong interactions remain confined.\nBy colliding hadrons, we study their internal structure and separate their constituents. However, there is no smaller scale where quarks and gluons can be isolated naturally.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe Fermi scale (10^{-15} \\ \\text{m}) is fundamental for understanding hadron physics, as it defines the confinement radius of strong interactions.\n\nThe most common elements on Earth, such as hydrogen, formed during these early stages, but their abundance reflects later astrophysical processes rather than primordial hadron dynamics."

There is a very small core, and around it, there is a lot of space where the electrons live, with no strong interaction.\nThe second item I wanted to discuss is what we know as the fundamental hardware. The Standard Model is the theory in particle physics that describes most of the known interactions. Putting aside neutrinos — because there are several open questions — roughly speaking, everything is well described.\nThe part responsible for strong interactions is quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The participants of the strong interactions are quarks and gluons. These are the only particles in the Standard Model that carry color charge. They carry the charge needed to interact. Similar to electrodynamics, only objects that are not neutral can interact.\nIn strong interactions, the relevant charge is not electric charge but color charge. We could have invented a different word for it, but it is analogous to electric charge in some ways. However, it is a different quantum number, and one should not mix them up. A particle charged electrically does not have to carry color charge, and vice versa.\nWe usually measure charge in elementary units. For example, the electromagnetic charge of the electron is -1, and the positron is +1. Similarly, quarks and gluons have color charge, but we do not assign them the same units as electric charge."

Once a non-trivial wave function exists, the particles are color charged.\nTo summarize the Standard Model, these are the only particles that carry color charge. Let me list other particles in the Standard Model: electrons, muons, and tau leptons. These are similar particles but with different masses. The electron orbits or compensates the charge of protons and neutrons in nuclei. The muon is a heavier version of the electron, and the tau lepton is much heavier than the muon. Both can exist in different configurations.\nOther particles in the Standard Model include photons and neutrinos. These do not carry color charge and thus do not interact via the strong force. However, they may still interact through other forces.\n\n[!NOTE]\nA particle without color charge does not interact strongly, but a particle with color charge must interact strongly. This does not exclude other interactions, such as electromagnetic forces.\n\nAll quarks have different quantum numbers, including electric charge. There are six quarks in the Standard Model, distinguished by their properties. They are grouped by their electric charge:\n- The upper row (up, charm, top) has a charge of +\\frac{2}{3}.\n- The lower row (down, strange, bottom) has a charge of -\\frac{1}{3}.\nThey are also divided into three generations along the horizontal axis:\n1.

The charm and bottom quarks (or charm quark) are studied extensively in colliders, particularly for precision physics and CP violation. The top quark, however, is measured well for Standard Model quantities related to Higgs physics and electroweak interactions.\nWe will focus on the five lighter quarks and not discuss the top quark much because its lifetime is so short that it decays before it can form hadrons. Thus, no hadrons contain top quarks, but all other quarks can form hadrons.\nMost of the matter we know consists of two types: mesons and baryons. We will discuss the constituent quark model, which classifies hadrons as either quark-antiquark pairs (mesons) or three-quark states (baryons).\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe gluon field also condenses during hadronization, contributing to confinement at small scales.\n\nThere is something very interesting happening around the chiral symmetry breaking scale.

The gluon field, similar to the Higgs field, forms a medium in which the quarks are moving. This medium is colored, and the quarks acquire energy by interacting with it. Effectively, the gluons dress the quarks, making them massive even if they were originally massless. The quarks we observe in the constituent picture differ from the Standard Model quarks — they are quarks dressed by gluonic degrees of freedom.\nThere is a useful way to think about this. Consider the masses of the light quarks, such as the up (u) and down (d) quarks, which are on the order of 3 MeV. To express this in kilograms, we use natural units, where c = 1 and \\hbar = 1.\n\n[!NOTE]\nIn natural units, quantities like energy, mass, and inverse distance can all be expressed in the same units (e.g., electron volts, MeV).\n\nThe relation between units is derived from fundamental constants.

This simplifies calculations in particle physics by eliminating redundant unit conversions.\n\nThus, when we say the mass of a quark is 3 MeV, we are directly using natural units where mass and energy are interchangeable. This framework is essential for understanding how quarks acquire effective masses through interactions with the gluon field."

To give a scale in kilograms, it’s roughly 10^{-30} — a very small number.\nNow, what is the mass of the proton? The proton is the elementary constituent of nuclei, made of up (u) and down (d) quarks. The mass of the proton is roughly 1 GeV. To be more precise, the mass density is around 10^{-10} g. For comparison, the proton mass is approximately 10^{-12} of this scale.\nThe Higgs mechanism involves the formation of a condensate, through which particles obtain their masses. The running of the mass couplings also contributes to mass generation. The mass acquired from the Higgs is a small fraction — about 3% — of the total proton mass.\nAnother phenomenon occurs where energy is stored in the strong interaction. At the scale where strong interactions dominate, there is a significant contribution from the gluon condensate. This gluonic energy accounts for 99% of the proton mass.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nWhen discussing the origin of mass, the Higgs mechanism explains only about 1% of the proton mass. The remaining 99% comes from gluon interactions.\n\nFor example, if I weigh 70 kg, most of that mass — around 69 kg — is due to gluon interactions and the binding energy of quarks.

There is a lot in common between these two theories.\nThe framework we use, starting from classical mechanics and extending to quantum systems, is the Lagrangian approach. Similar to mechanical systems, we describe quantum systems using the Lagrangian and Lagrange equations.\nLet’s start with QED. What is QED? Essentially, QED is the theory of the electromagnetic field. If someone asks you about the key equation in QED, the first thing that comes to mind is the Maxwell equations, which are the equations of motion for the electric and magnetic fields.\nThe index \\mu in the equations indicates that we are dealing with a vector field. This means that under boosts and rotations, the field transforms as a vector, just like momentum or other familiar four-vectors. For example, the zero component of a four-vector corresponds to the time component (like energy for momentum), while the spatial components represent the vector part (like momentum for a particle).\nWhen you see the index \\mu on a field, you know how to boost and rotate it because it belongs to the vector representation of the Lorentz group. If I give you a four-vector field and ask how it transforms under a 90-degree rotation, you can apply the rotation matrix:\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\cos \\theta & \\sin \\theta \\\\\n0 & -\\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nSimilarly, you know how to boost this field using the Lorentz transformation matrix with \\gamma and \\beta factors.

    "text": "18 Phase Update and Derivative Action in Gauge Transformations\nIt’s intuitive that you should be able to update the phase. The tricky part is that the phase is updated differently at every spacetime point — this is not a global phase rotation for all fields. Instead, we independently decide the phase update at each point in spacetime.\nThis local transformation requires careful handling of the derivative. When the Lagrangian transforms under this update, the derivative acts not only on the field but also on the phase factor, introducing an extra term.\nFor example, consider the derivative acting on a field \\Psi with a phase factor e^{iQ\\theta(x)}:\n\n\\partial_\\mu \\Psi \\rightarrow \\partial_\\mu (e^{iQ\\theta(x)}\\Psi) = e^{iQ\\theta(x)}(\\partial_\\mu + iQ \\partial_\\mu \\theta) \\Psi\n\nThe extra term iQ \\partial_\\mu \\theta arises from the derivative acting on the phase. This leads to a modification of the Lagrangian:\n\n\\mathcal{L} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{L} + (\\text{extra term})\n\nTo restore gauge invariance, we introduce the covariant derivative D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - iq A_\\mu. When both the phase \\theta(x) and the gauge field A_\\mu transform simultaneously:\n\n\\Psi \\rightarrow e^{iQ\\theta(x)}\\Psi, \\quad A_\\mu \\rightarrow A_\\mu + \\partial_\\mu \\theta\n\nthe extra term from the phase update is exactly canceled by the shift in A_\\mu. This ensures the Lagrangian remains invariant under local gauge transformations."

    "text": "19 Gauge Invariance and Interaction Structure in Field Theory\nThe extra term in the Lagrangian gets compensated by the change under gauge transformation. If you think carefully, it becomes clear. When \\Psi is replaced, we know how the Lagrangian changes under the gauge transformation — specifically, under the phase change.\nLet’s apply this to the total Lagrangian of electrodynamics. The new term we don’t modify, but the original Lagrangian transforms and acquires an extra term. The term \\Psi^\\dagger \\gamma^\\mu Q A_\\mu \\Psi changes according to the gauge transformation, and this term precisely cancels the extra term introduced by the phase transformation.\nThis is a super important concept in field theory. The interaction between fields and fermions is dictated by gauge invariance. We require the ability to change the phase at every point in spacetime while keeping the Lagrangian invariant. The phase update determines the structure of interactions.\nFrom this Lagrangian, if you derive the equations of motion using the Euler-Lagrange equations, you won’t just get the Dirac equation — there will also be a source term. This shows that the field is not free; it interacts with photons. The term A_\\mu \\Psi^\\dagger \\gamma^\\mu \\Psi introduces interactions.\nThe entire field theory for vector mesons is built on this principle. The key characteristic we enforce is how the phase transformation acts on the field. Let me ask: what is the dimensionality of the phase factor e^{iQ\\theta(x)}? Is it a matrix, a vector, or something else?\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe phase factor e^{iQ\\theta(x)} is a scalar. You exponentiate a scalar to get another scalar — it’s just a number.\n\nGauge invariance does more than just defining particle interactions; it determines the entire structure of interactions. Depending on the phase transformation chosen, we obtain different interaction terms.\nThe gauge field A_\\mu must transform as A_\\mu \\rightarrow A_\\mu + \\partial_\\mu \\theta to cancel the extra term from the phase update. This ensures the Lagrangian remains invariant under local gauge transformations. The covariant derivative D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - iQ A_\\mu is crucial for maintaining this invariance."

The final aspect of field theoretical interactions involves examining various phase transformations and spanning all classes of field theory.\n\nIf the phase is a scalar, you obtain electrodynamics.\n\nIf the phase is a 2 \\times 2 matrix, you derive the Yang-Mills series, leading to electric interactions mediated by W and Z bosons.\n\nIf the phase is a 3 \\times 3 matrix, you arrive at quantum chromodynamics (QCD).\n\nThese theories are interconnected. The dimensionality of the field must adjust to the phase transformation. The Dirac field always retains four components in the Lorentz representation, as these correspond to spacetime rotations. However, an additional index can be introduced for non-scalar transformations, allowing the wave function to carry dimensionality in the charge field.\n\n[!NOTE]\nIn electromagnetism, only photons exist, corresponding to a single dimension. In weak interactions, there are three fields (W^+, W^-, Z), representing dimension-two objects (spinors).\n\nThe Standard Model organizes particles into doublets (e.g., up and down quarks), reflecting the gauge group’s dimensionality. The number of interaction carriers determines the gauge group structure.\nThe phase transformation is characterized by a Lie group, which defines the set of transformations preserving the group structure.

To compute this, you perform a Fourier expansion and iteratively multiply the matrix by itself — once, twice, and so on. This matrix has a simple pattern: squaring it results in a diagonal matrix, allowing truncation of the series after a few iterations.\nThe Gell-Mann matrices \\lambda_a (where a = 1, \\dots, 8) are the generators of SU(3).

The theory involves color dimensions, Lorentz dimensions, and gluon fields A_\\mu^a. The term A_\\mu^a A_\\nu^b represents gluon self-interactions.\nAn important exercise is to recover the QCD equations of motion, where you will see that the color structure dominates. A key aspect of this theory is that it is fundamentally different due to the gluon self-interaction term. Even without quarks, gluons still interact with each other.\nWhen deriving the equations of motion, these interaction terms alter gluon behavior compared to photons. The self-interactions of gluons lead to confinement, where color forces exhibit screening behavior distinct from electric forces.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nIn quantum field theory, the strength of interactions depends on the energy scale at which they are probed, a phenomenon tied to renormalization. The strong coupling constant g_s in the Lagrangian is a bare parameter, but the effective coupling varies with energy.\n\nGluons screen the color charge, but this screening differs between QED and QCD. In QED, the coupling weakens at larger distances (lower energies). In QCD, the strong coupling grows stronger at lower energies, leading to confinement.\nAt small energy scales, gluons and quarks form bound states due to the increasing strength of the interaction. This prevents isolated quarks or gluons from existing freely — they are confined within hadrons.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe low-energy regime where confinement occurs contrasts with the high-energy regime of asymptotic freedom, where the coupling weakens. The transition between these regimes is driven by gluon self-interactions.\n\nEven in a theory without quarks, gluon self-interactions persist, meaning there is no truly “free” QCD theory. These interactions are responsible for both confinement at low energies and asymptotic freedom at high energies. The latter is particularly relevant in Higgs physics, where high-energy probes are used."

When the coupling is small, you can expand the equations of motion and iterate using the fact that the coupling is small. This leads to the perturbative approach.\nThe diagrammatic representation of this process is the Feynman diagram method, which allows you to compute the matrix element \\mathcal{M}.

The phase space d\\Phi accounts for the available configurations of the final state.\nFor example, in a 2-body decay, you explicitly count the number of final-state configurations.

Not an exact calculation, but just an order of magnitude.\nThe precise method involves integrating over all possible configurations of the squared matrix element |\\mathcal{M}_{if}|^2, summing over final states, and accounting for flux and initial-state averaging. The formula is:\n\n\\sigma = \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{(p_1 \\cdot p_2)^2 - m_1^2 m_2^2}} \\frac{1}{N_i} \\sum_f |\\mathcal{M}_{if}|^2 d\\Phi_n\n\n\n\\mathcal{M}_{if}: Transition matrix element (initial \\to final).\n\nN_i: Initial state averaging factor (spins, colors, etc.).\n\nd\\Phi_n: n-body phase space element.\n\nThis gives the cross section in units of inverse GeV, which can then be converted to centimeters squared.\nBut for a rough estimate, think of the cross section as an effective interaction area. Imagine a proton as a target fixed in space, and another proton colliding with it. The cross section represents the area where the reaction occurs — if the projectile misses this area, no interaction happens.\nThe characteristic size of a proton is about 1 fermi (1 \\ \\text{fm} = 10^{-13} \\ \\text{cm}). The cross section is then roughly the geometric area:\n\n\\sigma \\sim \\pi r^2 \\approx 10 \\ \\text{mb}\n\nwhere 1 \\ \\text{b} = 10^{-24} \\ \\text{cm}^2.\nFor hadrons, the total cross section is determined by their overlapping densities. If they are too far apart, they don’t interact — the strong interaction is very strong but short-ranged.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe typical hadronic cross section scale is around 10 millibarns, derived from the proton’s size.\n\nNow, let’s transition to symmetries in hadron physics, starting with QCD and the SU group. This will lead us to isospin and the SU flavor group, where we’ll explore how quark interchange relates to spin addition and the Lorentz group.\nThis part of the discussion is particularly elegant because it relies on fundamental spin algebra, something you can work out independently with just pen and paper.\nLet me begin by reminding you of the last lecture’s key points and addressing any questions before moving forward.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nThe cross-section estimation hinges on the proton’s size (\\sim 1 \\ \\text{fm}), translating to an interaction area of \\sim 10 \\ \\text{mb}.\n\nWe’ll now proceed to discuss symmetries, starting with QCD and the SU group, and then connecting it to the phenomenology of the SU flavor group.\nThe addition of spins inside hadrons mirrors the addition of quark states, and this will be a recurring theme as we link it to the Lorentz group’s rotational subgroup, SU(2).\nThis material should feel familiar from quantum mechanics, and I hope it will be straightforward to follow.\nLet’s start by reviewing the last lecture’s content and addressing any lingering questions before diving deeper into symmetries."

The charge can be probed using photons.\nIn QCD, the charge is the color charge, associated with the SU(3) gauge group. The charge operator in QCD is given by:\n\nQ^a_{QCD} = g_s\\int d^3x \\, \\Psi_i^\\dagger(x) \\gamma^0 T^a \\Psi_j(x)\n\nwhere T^a are the generators of SU(3).\nNow, suppose we are given a field \\Psi. How do we determine its charge? The charge is a conserved quantity, meaning that for a freely moving field, the charge does not change. This conservation arises from a symmetry, as stated by Noether’s theorem, which guarantees a conserved current. The charge is then defined as the integral of the zero-component of this conserved current.\nFor the Dirac field, the charge density is \\Psi^\\dagger \\Psi, which is a positive quantity for physical solutions. If \\Psi represents an electron, this would imply a positive charge. At first glance, this seems contradictory, but the sign of the charge is a matter of convention. We define the observed charge Q to match our physical conventions, such as assigning -e to the electron. The overall normalization is arbitrary; what matters is the conservation law.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe sign of the charge in QED is a convention. The conserved quantity is the key feature, not the specific value assigned to particles like the electron.\n\nThe strong interaction is very strong but operates only at short distances.

The key is that when considering multiple quarks, the group structure changes. Here, we stick with SU(2), where we only permute the two quarks.\nHigher-dimensional representations appear when combining particles—such as multiple quarks—into a single system. This introduces a tensor product structure, where the total isospin (or spin) of the combined system must be considered.\nFor example, if we have two systems, each with isospin 1/2, their combined state can form:\n- A triplet (J = 1):\n\n  \\frac{uu + dd}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\quad ud, \\quad du\n   - A singlet (J = 0):\n\n  \\frac{ud - du}{\\sqrt{2}}\n  \nThis is analogous to combining spins in quantum mechanics.

The general rule for angular momentum addition is:\n\nj_1 \\otimes j_2 = |j_1 - j_2| \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus (j_1 + j_2)\n\nHere, j_1 and j_2 are the spins of the two systems being combined, and the resulting total spin J can take any value from |j_1 - j_2| up to j_1 + j_2.\nFor example, combining spin \\frac{1}{2} with another spin \\frac{1}{2} gives possible total spins of 0 and 1. Similarly, if we combine spin 3 and spin 2, the possible total spins are:\n\n3 \\otimes 2 = 1 \\oplus 2 \\oplus 3 \\oplus 4 \\oplus 5\n\nThe dimensions of these representations follow the sequence:\n\n\\text{Dim: } 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11\n\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nThe dimensions on the left and right must match. For spin 3 (dimension 7) and spin 2 (dimension 5), the total dimension is 7 \\times 5 = 35. On the right, the sum of dimensions is 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 35. This consistency is a crucial check when combining spins.\n\nThe basis in this space can be thought of as unit vectors in each dimension. For example, a 35-dimensional vector has blocks corresponding to the different spin sectors: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.\n\n[!NOTE]\nGroup theory tells us that these blocks do not mix under rotations. A matrix acting on this 35-dimensional space will only rotate components within each block, not between them. This is the essence of irreducible representations.\n\nIf a system has a total spin of 3, no rotation can change it to 4. This is a fundamental property: under rotations, the total spin is preserved. Mathematically, this means the interaction matrix is block-diagonal, with no mixing between different spin sectors.\nNow that we understand how to combine spins, we can apply this to practical examples. The key takeaway is that the dimensions must align, and the resulting representations decompose into independent blocks corresponding to each possible total spin."

The quark content here is `uud`, `udd`, etc.\nFor \\Delta^{++}:\n- The state is `3\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\left( p^\\uparrow p^\\uparrow p^\\uparrow \\right)\\right)`\n- Isospin calculation:\n\nI_{\\Delta^{++}} = \\frac{3}{2} \\left\\{ \\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} \\right\\} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2}\n\nFor \\Delta^+:\n- The state is `\\frac{3}{2} \\left( p^\\uparrow p^\\uparrow p^\\downarrow \\right)`\n- Isospin projection: `\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}`\nQuestion 2: What is the dimensionality of the isospin matrix acting on a space of three quarks with two charges (up and down)? If we treat the quarks as wavefunctions in two dimensions—where spin-up corresponds to the `u`-quark and spin-down to the `d`-quark—what is the size of this matrix?\nQuestion 3: What are the irreducible representations of this matrix acting on the quarks? In other words, how does it split into independent blocks that do not mix?\n\n[!NOTE]\nWhen discussing isospin, we focus only on light quarks (`u`, `d`). The \\Delta baryons are composed of these light quarks.\n\nI will return shortly to discuss these questions further. For now, think about the quark content and how it relates to isospin symmetry."

The dimensionality of the isospin matrix acting on three quarks is determined by the isospin space `I = 3/2`. For `SU(2)`, there are no decuplets or octets — those belong to `SU(3)`. However, the combination rules remain analogous.\nFor example, the combination `UUU` has isospin `I_3 = 3/2`, while `DDD` has `I_3 = -3/2`. Intermediate states like `UUD` and `UDD` correspond to `I_3 = 1/2` and `I_3 = -1/2`, respectively.\nTo construct the quark flavor basis functions, we start with the state of maximum spin or flavor, which is `|3/2, 3/2\\rangle` (using spin or flavor notation equivalently). We then apply the lowering operator `J_-` to generate the remaining states. The action of the lowering operator is given by:\n\nJ_- |j, m\\rangle = \\sqrt{j(j+1) - m(m-1)} \\ |j, m-1\\rangle\n\nFor the case where `j = m = 3/2`, this simplifies to:\n\nJ_- |3/2, 3/2\\rangle = \\sqrt{3} \\ |3/2, 1/2\\rangle\n\nThe lowering operator `J_-` can be decomposed into individual quark operators:\n\nJ_- = J_-^{(1)} \\otimes \\mathbb{I}^{(2)} \\otimes \\mathbb{I}^{(3)} + \\mathbb{I}^{(1)} \\otimes J_-^{(2)} \\otimes \\mathbb{I}^{(3)} + \\mathbb{I}^{(1)} \\otimes \\mathbb{I}^{(2)} \\otimes J_-^{(3)}\n\nWhen applied to `UUU`, this yields a superposition of states like `UUD`, ensuring proper normalization. The normalization condition requires that:\n\n\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = 1\n\nThis is enforced using orthogonality relations: identical quark flavors (e.g., `UU`) are normalized, while different flavors (e.g., `UD`) are orthogonal.\nWe can continue applying the lowering operator to generate the full multiplet, including states with `I_3 = -3/2`.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nThe antiparticle of `\\Xi_c^+` is not `\\Xi_c^-` but rather `\\overline{\\Xi_c^-}`.

The wave function for this state is a combination like `u^2(3ud + u du + e du)`, and another term like `(dud + d du + u du)`. This is straightforward for the highest spin state.\nRecall that we previously discussed spin `S = 47`, which gives a dimensionality of 95. To build this from spin `1/2` particles, we need 94 spin `1/2` particles — essentially 94 “legs.” If we want to generate the 95-dimensional space (or 333, referring to the `E_z` basis), we simply apply the lowering operator 62 times. This process can be automated.\nThe situation becomes more complicated when considering intermediate spins, such as 90. Combining 94 spin `1/2` particles allows for various total spin states. Can we get spin 0? Yes. Can we get spin 1? Yes. All intermediate spins are possible, with different multiplicities.\nThe dimensionality of the matrix acting on this space is `2^{94}`, since each spin `1/2` particle contributes a 2-dimensional representation. This can be written as a tensor product:\n\n2 \\otimes 2 \\otimes 2 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes 2 \\quad (\\text{94 times})\n\nThis space decomposes into irreducible representations, corresponding to different spin combinations.

The number 94 is very large, but one of these combinations corresponds to spin 94 with different multiplicities.

The dimensionality here is determined by the basis vectors in the tensor product space. Each quark contributes a doublet, so the total number of basis vectors is:\n\n2 \\otimes 2 \\otimes 2 = 8\n\nThis means there are eight basis functions in the space of three quarks.

This means our rotation matrix, which is `8 \\times 8`, can be split into blocks of 2 dimensions, 3 dimensions, and 4 dimensions, corresponding to the irreducible representations (irreps).\nIt is clear how to construct the reducible basis for the highest isospin state. You start with the known state, such as `|up, up, up\\rangle`, and then act with the lowering operator. However, constructing the other basis vectors requires more care.\nFor the `1/2` and `3/2` isospin states, we have 4-plets and 2-plets. The key principle is that the new vectors we build must be orthogonal to what we’ve already constructed. We need wavefunctions with the same quark combinations but different coefficients to ensure orthogonality.\nFor example, consider the combination:\n\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\left( |u d u\\rangle + |u u d\\rangle - 2 |d u u\\rangle \\right)\n\nTo verify orthogonality, we compute the scalar product with another state. When multiplying, only terms with identical quark content contribute. For normalization, squaring this gives:\n\n1 + 1 + 4 = 6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{Normalization factor} \\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\n\nTo construct the basis function for the `1/2` state with projection `-1/2`, we act with the lowering operator on the upper state.

The framework applies not only to half-integer spins but also to integer spins. When combining two spin-1 systems, we use spin algebra to determine the possible states, ranging from the lowest (spin-0) to the highest (spin-2).\nWe verify the dimensionality by checking:\n\n3 + 3 = 1 + 3 + 5\n\nThis confirms the decomposition into irreducible representations.

I hope Ilya can discuss rescheduling it to another day. Skipping two weeks would be too much, but we will be back from CERN on Monday, and the next lecture will proceed as planned on Tuesday.\nToday’s lecture will focus on experiments in spectroscopy and kinematics computations. Before diving into that, let’s recap the last lecture and address two key questions:\n\nCompute the magnetic moment in the current model of the Omega baryon.\n\nCompute the lowest `1s` multiplet excitation of the `\\Sigma_p` parameter (related to ISIS spin factors).\n\nFor question 1, we first need the quark content of the `\\Omega^-` baryon: three strange quarks (`sss`). The total wave function is a product of color, isospin, spin, and flavor components, but color and isospin are factored out, leaving only flavor and spin. The flavor part is trivial, so we focus on spin.\nThe spin configuration must yield a total spin of `3/2` for the `\\Omega^-` baryon, with parity `+`. This implies orbital angular momentum `L = 1`, and the spin must be `1/2` to achieve the correct total angular momentum `J = 3/2`.\nFor question 2, the `1s` multiplet excitation of `\\Sigma_p` involves understanding the spin structure of the system, particularly how the spin states align to form the lowest-energy configuration.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe `\\Omega^-` baryon’s magnetic moment arises from the contributions of its three strange quarks, each with spin `1/2`. The total spin configuration must be symmetric to match the observed `J = 3/2` state.\n\n\n[!TIP]\nWhen computing the `1s` multiplet, remember that the lowest-energy state corresponds to the most symmetric spin arrangement, minimizing repulsive interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parity of the Omega baryon is plus, which implies the orbital angular momentum `L = 1`. The spin is `3/2`, giving a total angular momentum `J = 3/2`. The multiplicity of the spin-`3/2` state is four, corresponding to the four possible projections along the `z`-axis: `+3/2, +1/2, -1/2, -3/2`.\nThe wave function for the `\\Omega^-` baryon is constructed from the spin states of the three strange quarks. Acting with the lowering operator on the highest weight state generates the other components, such as `|\\downarrow\\uparrow\\uparrow\\rangle`, `|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\uparrow\\rangle`, and `|\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle`, each with a coefficient of `1/\\sqrt{3}`.\nThe magnetic moment operator is given by:\n\\mu_z = \\mu_{1z} + \\mu_{2z} + \\mu_{3z}\nWhen applied to the state, it acts as an eigenoperator. For example, `\\mu_{1z}` acting on `|\\uparrow\\uparrow\\uparrow\\rangle` returns the spin projection multiplied by the charge factor. The charge of each strange quark is `-1/3`, so the total charge contribution is:\n\\mu \\propto \\sum_{i=1}^3 q_i \\cdot s_{iz}\nFor the `\\Omega^-` baryon, the total charge is `-1`, and the dominant contribution comes from the spin alignment. The magnetic moment is then:\n\\mu \\approx \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_s c}\nwhere `m_s` is the mass of the strange quark (approximately 500 MeV). Compared to the electron’s magnetic moment, this is smaller by a factor of `10^3` due to the larger mass of the strange quark.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe `\\Omega^-` baryon’s magnetic moment is determined by the spin and charge contributions of its three strange quarks, with the mass scale set by the strange quark mass.\n\n\n[!TIP]\nWhen computing magnetic moments, focus on the highest weight state first, as the other states can be generated using ladder operators. The proportionality to spin simplifies the calculation.\n\nThe charge of the `\\Omega^-` baryon is `-1`, arising from the sum of the three strange quark charges. The magnetic moment is thus suppressed relative to the electron due to the heavier mass scale involved.\n\n\n\n\nThe magnetic moment of the `\\Omega^-` baryon is negative because of its negative charge, but it is 10,000 times smaller than that of the electron. The charge of the `\\Omega^-` is also negative, so our intuition holds that the magnetic moment should be negative. However, the mass scale in the magnetic moment formula is determined by the quark mass rather than the mass of the `\\Omega^-` itself. If the quark mass is roughly 500 MeV, then the mass of the `\\Omega^-` would be around 1500 MeV (three times the quark mass).\n\n[!TIP]\nWhen calculating magnetic moments, it is simplest to work with the maximal spin projection state, as it avoids complications from mixed spin configurations.\n\nThe excitation pattern of the `\\Sigma_b` baryon is determined by its light diquark configuration, which in the ground state has spin `S = 1` and parity `1/2^+`. A bonus question concerns the isospin partners of this baryon. Since the isospin of the `\\Sigma_b` is `I = 1`, the isospin multiplet has three charge states corresponding to the projections `I_z = +1, 0, -1`.\nThe charges of these states are determined by their quark composition:\n- `\\Sigma_b^+` ( `uu b` ) has charge `+1` (like a proton but with a bottom quark).\n- `\\Sigma_b^0` ( `ud b` ) has charge `0`.\n- `\\Sigma_b^-` ( `dd b` ) has charge `-1`.\nActing with the isospin lowering operator reduces the charge by one unit, so the pattern is straightforward.\n\n[!NOTE]\nIsospin symmetry is only slightly broken by quark mass differences, so the excitation patterns for all three `\\Sigma_b` states are nearly identical.\n\nThe excitation spectrum is determined by spin rather than isospin. Since all three isospin partners are related by symmetry, their properties—including their excited states—are very similar. The small isospin breaking due to quark mass differences is negligible for most practical purposes.\n\\mu \\approx \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_q c}\nwhere `m_q` is the quark mass, explains why the magnetic moment is suppressed compared to lighter particles like the electron.\nThe wave function for the `\\Omega^-` baryon is constructed from the spin states of the three strange quarks, with the magnetic moment operator given by:\n\\mu_z = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\mu_{iz}\nFor the highest spin projection state, the magnetic moment is straightforward to evaluate, as it depends only on the quark charges and spins. The charge of each strange quark is `-1/3`, so the total charge is `-1`.\n\n\n\n\nThe excitation pattern remains the same regardless of which state we consider as the lowest. For the diagram, we plot different quantum numbers on the x-axis, typically orbital angular momentum in the excitation spectrum, and the rest mass energy (or hadron mass) on the y-axis.\nTo construct this, we start by combining the spins of the light quarks and the heavy quark. For most hadrons (except light mesons), the radial excitation—moving from 1s to 2s orbitals—is much larger than hyperfine splitting. This is always true for heavy quarks. The energy difference from combining spins is suppressed by a factor of the heavy quark mass:\n\\Delta E \\sim \\frac{1}{m_Q}\nFor an S-wave state, combining a light diquark with spin `S = 1` and a heavy quark with spin `S = 1/2` yields two possible states:\nJ = \\frac{1}{2} \\oplus \\frac{3}{2}\nWhen adding one unit of orbital angular momentum (P-wave), we must consider both spin combinations separately. The multiplicity for the P-block is 5, while the S-block has a multiplicity of 2. The lowest states are `\\frac{1}{2}^+` and `\\frac{3}{2}^+`, followed by five P-wave states. These correspond to distinct particles listed in the PDG, though some (like `\\Sigma_b(300)`) were discovered relatively recently.\nThe energy splitting between states arises from the heavy quark spin dynamics, while radial excitations are governed by QCD dynamics at the scale of `\\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}}` (a few hundred MeV). The splitting within a block is suppressed by the heavy quark mass.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe strong coupling diverges at `\\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}}`, setting the energy scale for radial excitations.\n\nFor the `\\Omega^-` baryon, the magnetic moment is negative due to its negative charge, though it is much smaller than the electron’s moment. The mass scale in the magnetic moment formula depends on the quark mass (`m_q \\approx 500 \\ \\text{MeV}`) rather than the baryon mass (`\\sim 1500 \\ \\text{MeV}`):\n\\mu \\approx \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_q c}\nThe `\\Sigma_b` baryon’s excitation pattern is determined by its light diquark (`S = 1`, `\\frac{1}{2}^+`). Its isospin partners form a triplet (`I = 1`) with charges:\n- `\\Sigma_b^+` (`uu b`): `+1`\n- `\\Sigma_b^0` (`ud b`): `0`\n- `\\Sigma_b^-` (`dd b`): `-1`\n\n[!TIP]\nIsospin symmetry is nearly exact here, as quark mass differences cause only minor breaking.\n\nThe magnetic moment operator for the `\\Omega^-` is:\n\\mu_z = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\mu_{iz}\nwhere each strange quark contributes `-1/3` to the total charge.\n\n\n\n\nThe energy difference between levels arises from the dynamics of the heavy quark spin. Since the quark is heavy, all spin effects are suppressed inversely proportional to its mass. In the Lagrangian (and in all effective theories), the spin-orbit interaction appears in terms where the heavy quark mass is in the denominator.\nFor example, the mass of the `b` quark is around `4 \\ \\text{GeV}`, which introduces an order-of-magnitude suppression. The QCD scale `\\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}}` is a few hundred MeV, setting the typical energy scale for these effects.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe spin-orbit coupling in heavy quark systems is suppressed by `1/m_Q`, where `m_Q` is the heavy quark mass.\n\nThe strong coupling diverges at `\\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}}`, governing the radial excitations, while spin-dependent splittings are smaller due to the heavy quark mass suppression.\n\n\n\n\nThe energy scale \\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}} is a few hundred MeV, while the typical excitation energies are on the order of a few GeV. The ratio between them is roughly 10:15, which reflects the difference between excitation energies of general quantum states and the splitting between specific levels.\nFor example, the energy difference between \\Sigma_b with spin 3/2 and \\Sigma_b with spin 1/2 is of the order of 10 MeV.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe splitting between heavy quark states like \\Sigma_b is governed by spin-dependent interactions, which are suppressed by the heavy quark mass.\n\nToday’s lecture focuses on the kinematics and experimental techniques in hadron physics. This field has been extremely vibrant in the last 10 years, starting around 2004 when the first exotic particles were discovered. Since then, new observations of states that do not fit the conventional quark model (mesons and baryons) have been reported frequently.\nMany experiments worldwide now dedicate part of their programs to studying hadrons, particularly exotic ones. Large laboratories conducting particle collisions contribute to this effort. A key challenge is understanding the fundamental structure of matter—how hadrons form, which combinations are possible, and what rules determine their excitation patterns and properties.\nQuantum Chromodynamics (QCD) describes strong interactions well in regimes where computations are feasible. However, there has been no success yet in systematically classifying and predicting large multiplets of exotic hadrons. Observations are made, but relating them to theoretical predictions remains difficult due to computational limitations and the complexity of QCD dynamics.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nThe strong coupling diverges at \\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}}, setting the scale for radial excitations, while spin-dependent effects are smaller due to heavy quark mass suppression.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe cannot do this partly because of the limitations of our computational methods. Lattice QCD, while effective for ground states, is not well-suited for computations at larger scales due to the complexity of the theory.\nThe phenomena in QCD reveal emerging behaviors that are not directly described by the Lagrangian’s quark and gluon degrees of freedom. Instead, we observe a transition in matter: from configurations where quark degrees of freedom dominate (such as quark-gluon plasma) to configurations where hadrons themselves become the relevant degrees of freedom (such as in atomic nuclei).\nIn hadron spectroscopy, this transition manifests as a boundary region where hadrons—composed of elementary quarks—coexist with larger atomic-scale objects. Here, hadrons bind into more complex structures, creating a mixed regime.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe transition between quark-dominated and hadron-dominated matter highlights the challenge of modeling QCD across different energy scales.\n\nThe theory’s complexity arises from the interplay of these scales, where neither perturbative methods nor pure lattice computations fully capture the dynamics. This is particularly evident in spectroscopy, where exotic states blur the line between quark-level and hadron-level descriptions.\n\n\n\n\nHadrons bind in larger objects, such as atomic nuclei, and some hadrons are complicated because their properties arise from a mixture of different configurations. Some properties require them to be compact hadrons, while others require them to be sparse hadronic molecules, which we refer to as “atoms” in hadron spectroscopy.\nCurrently, lattice QCD cannot fully address these complexities, so experiments worldwide provide new data and insights. Researchers understand these phenomena by measuring hadron properties and their decays. One approach is to observe hadrons in new decay configurations, which yield valuable information. Another is to measure the same hadron but from different production mechanisms.\nSeveral laboratories explore these mechanisms:\n- Belle II (Japan) and BESIII (China): These experiments collide electrons and positrons, which annihilate to produce intermediate states that decay. The resulting particles are studied to understand hadron properties.\n- LHC (CERN): Here, protons (not proton-antiproton pairs) are collided, producing a high-energy environment with many particles. Among these are long-lived particles like `B` and `D` mesons, which travel a few millimeters before decaying. Detectors track these particles, distinguishing primary and secondary vertices.\nAnother class of experiments uses hadronic production, where a hadron is fired at another hadron without fully describing the kinematics. These are typically fixed-target experiments, such as:\n- GLUEX (Jefferson Lab): Uses a photon beam on a hydrogen target.\n- COMPASS (CERN): Uses a pion beam on a hydrogen target.\nIn these setups, the target particle is either excited or scatters, providing another way to study hadrons.\nThe third major approach is computing hadron properties from lattice QCD, though this method has limitations for certain states.\n\n[!NOTE]\nDifferent production mechanisms (lepton collisions, proton collisions, hadronic scattering) provide complementary insights into hadron structure and dynamics.\n\nThe interplay between these experimental methods helps clarify the transition between quark-dominated and hadron-dominated matter, a key challenge in QCD.\n\n\n\n\nThe third major way to study hadrons is to compute their properties from lattice QCD, which provides a large piece of information.\nLet’s overview the production mechanism and experiments. We start with the Beijing Spectrometer (BESIII), located at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC). This accelerator complex collides electrons and positrons. The experiment is dedicated to studying hadrons in the energy regions of charmonium and bottomonium.\nBEPC is a symmetric collider, meaning the electron and positron have the same energy. When they collide, one possible interaction is annihilation, producing a virtual photon that couples to a hadron.\nThe spin configurations in these collisions are constrained. An electron has spin `1/2`, and at high energies, it has a specific helicity. When combining two spin-`1/2` particles (electron and positron), the possible total spin states are `0` or `1`. However, due to their nature as particle-antiparticle pairs and helicity conservation, the produced system can only have spin `1` — spin `0` is forbidden in this combination.\nAdditionally, the parity of the system is determined by the combination of the electron (`1/2^-`) and positron (`1/2^+`) in an `S`-wave state.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe spin and parity selection rules in electron-positron collisions restrict the possible hadronic states produced, providing a clean environment for studying specific quantum numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe combine particles with quantum numbers `1/2^-` and `1/2^+` in an `S`-wave configuration. This experiment focuses on hadrons produced with quantum numbers `1^-`. The data collection process involves setting the beam energy to accumulate large datasets, such as millions of events for the `J/\\psi` peak.\nWhen plotting the cross section as a function of energy, the distribution is not homogeneous but exhibits peaking structures. These peaks occur when the system resonates at specific frequencies, corresponding to hadronic states. By tuning the collision energy to match these resonances, the interaction probability (and thus the cross section) increases.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe cross section magnitude indicates interaction frequency and directly influences the data volume recorded.\n\nThe `J/\\psi` peak is a prominent example. The German spectrum (shown here) plots orbital excitations on the `X`-axis and system energy on the `Y`-axis. The lowest state is followed by higher multiplicities, derived from quark algebra. The `J/\\psi` and `\\eta_c` belong to the same multiplet, with `J/\\psi` being the first discovered charmonium state.\nThe `J/\\psi` is a clear peak in the `e^+e^-` cross section spectrum, with quantum numbers `1^-`. Its production is straightforward due to quantum number selection rules in relativistic collisions. The second peak in the spectrum corresponds to the excited state `\\psi(2S)`.\nThe naming convention for `J/\\psi` reflects its discovery history, where “J” honors one of the lead researchers. This state is a benchmark for studying charmonium spectroscopy due to its clean experimental signature.\n\\sigma(E) \\propto \\text{Resonance amplitude at energy } E\nThe cross section enhancement at resonance energies (`E_{\\text{res}}`) follows the Breit-Wigner distribution:\n\\sigma(E) \\sim \\frac{\\Gamma^2/4}{(E - E_{\\text{res}})^2 + \\Gamma^2/4}\nwhere `\\Gamma` is the resonance width.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nResonance peaks provide direct access to hadronic states with specific quantum numbers, enabling systematic studies of quarkonium spectra.\n\nThe `\\psi(2S)` state, as an excitation of the `J/\\psi` system, further probes the dynamics of heavy quark bound states.\n\n\n\n\nIn the spectrum, the excitation of this system is the \\psi(2S), which we refer to simply as “psi” here. The lowest state in the multiplet is called the J/\\psi, while the four states in the P-multiplet are labeled \\chi_{c0}, \\chi_{c1}, \\chi_{c2}, and h_c (with quantum numbers 0^+, 1^+, 2^+, and 1^+ respectively).\nFor data collection, there are two primary methods:\n1. Resonance peak sitting: Accumulating data at the J/\\psi peak yields billions of events where the J/\\psi is produced and decays into various final states.\n2. Energy scan: By tuning the beam energy over weeks, we measure the cross section at discrete points, building a profile of the resonance structure.\nThe total cross section is a superposition of all possible sub-processes, such as e^+e^- \\to \\text{hadrons}. Some resonances are more prominent in specific decay kinematics, so researchers often analyze a particular final state (e.g., e^+e^- \\to 3\\pi) at a selected scan point to extract hadron properties.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe cross section enhancement follows the Breit-Wigner distribution:\n\n\\sigma(E) \\sim \\frac{\\Gamma^2/4}{(E - E_{\\text{res}})^2 + \\Gamma^2/4}\nwhere `\\Gamma` is the resonance width and `E_{\\text{res}}` is the resonance energy.\nThe J/\\psi and \\Upsilon families provide clean signatures for studying quarkonium spectroscopy due to their well-defined quantum numbers (1^-) and relativistic production mechanisms. The \\psi(2S) serves as an excited-state benchmark, probing the dynamics of heavy quark bound systems.\n\n\n\n\nThe BEL2 experiment in Japan was originally designed with the primary goal of studying CP violation, but its data proved extremely valuable for hadron spectroscopy as well. This experiment operates as an electron-positron collider and is located at KEK. It was initially called the Belle experiment, and after an upgrade 10 years ago, it became known as the SuperKEKB experiment. The predecessor was called Belle, and the upgraded version is referred to as Belle II.\nIn contrast to the Belle experiment, the colliding beams in Belle II are not symmetric. The center-of-mass energy is adjusted to a specific resonance, primarily to study B mesons and CP violation. The experiment operates at the `\\Upsilon(4S)` resonance, which predominantly decays into a `B\\bar{B}` pair.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nThe `\\Upsilon(4S)` is a short-lived resonance that decays immediately, leaving the primary vertex and producing a `B\\bar{B}` pair. The physics of CP violation is then studied using these decays.\n\nA key question is why the beam energies are asymmetric. This design choice is deliberate and clever. By giving the electron and positron beams different energies, the entire system receives a boost when produced. This boost is in the direction of the higher-energy beam (the electron beam) due to energy conservation.\nThe boost has a significant effect on the B mesons:\n- The B mesons gain a substantial longitudinal momentum.\n- They live longer in the laboratory frame due to relativistic time dilation.\n- They travel farther from the primary vertex before decaying.\nThis increased flight distance is crucial for precise vertex reconstruction. By measuring the displacement between the primary vertex and the decay point (secondary vertex), we can better identify and reconstruct B meson decays. The charged tracks from these decays do not point back to the primary vertex, providing a clear signature of secondary vertices.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe boost effect can be quantified using relativistic kinematics. The Lorentz factor `\\gamma` and the velocity `\\beta` determine the observed lifetime `\\tau_{\\text{lab}}` in the lab frame:\n\n\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau_0, \\quad \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m}, \\quad \\beta = \\frac{p}{E}\nwhere `\\tau_0` is the proper lifetime, `E` is the energy, `m` is the mass, and `p` is the momentum of the B meson.\nThis technique enhances our ability to separate signal from background and improves the precision of CP violation measurements. Before moving away from Belle II, let me connect this back to what we discussed earlier.\n\n\n\n\nLet me relate to what we just discussed earlier. Essentially, it’s the same process of `e^+e^-` annihilation, so we consider the total cross section `\\sigma(e^+e^- \\to \\text{everything})`.\nThe Belle experiment operates in the energy region of `J/\\psi` and `\\tau` production (charmonium), while the Belle II experiment focuses on the bottomonium region. Charmonium consists of `c\\bar{c}` states, while bottomonium is made of `b\\bar{b}` pairs.\nMoving to higher energies, around 10 GeV, we enter the bottomonium system, which is structurally similar to charmonium. However, since the `b` quark is even heavier, the hyperfine splitting is smaller. The mass difference between the `\\eta_b` and the vector bottomonium state ( `\\Upsilon` ) is reduced compared to charmonium.\nThe energy scale between levels remains roughly the same (a few hundred MeV), but within each multiplet, the states are more tightly packed. The `\\Upsilon` is the vector particle (spin `1^{--}`) and is the bottomonium counterpart of the `J/\\psi` in charmonium.\n\n\n\n\nThe Upsilon (`\\Upsilon`) is a vector particle with spin `1^{--}`, analogous to the `J/\\psi` in the charmonium spectrum. The `J/\\psi` is the easiest particle to produce in the charmonium spectrum due to its quantum numbers (`1^{--}`), especially in electron-positron annihilation, making it the most studied state.\nIn the bottomonium spectrum, the counterpart of the `J/\\psi` is the `\\Upsilon`. The notation `4s` refers to the fourth excited state in the bottomonium spectrum, arising from the `4 \\times` acceleration of the spectrum. When scanning the energy, the states appear sequentially: first the `\\Upsilon(1s)`, then `\\Upsilon(2s)`, `\\Upsilon(3s)`, and finally `\\Upsilon(4s)`.\nAll these states lie above the threshold for `B`-meson production, with masses exceeding 9 GeV. For example, the `\\Upsilon(1s)` has a mass around 9.46 GeV, while higher states like `\\Upsilon(4s)` are even heavier.\nProton-proton collisions are significantly more complex than electron-positron annihilations. The multiplicity of particles produced in such collisions is very high, increasing with energy. At the LHC, with proton beams at 7.7 TeV, the collisions are symmetric. However, since these are not annihilation processes, the produced particles are typically boosted due to the initial quark and gluon interactions.\nThe typical multiplicity of particles produced in a single proton-proton collision is on the order of thousands. The transverse momentum (`p_T`) spectrum follows an exponential distribution, with most particles at low momentum and a tail extending to higher energies. The typical energy scale for particles in these collisions is hundreds of GeV, though individual particle energies can range from tens to hundreds of GeV.\n\\frac{dN}{dp_T} \\sim e^{-p_T / T}\nHere, `T` represents the characteristic temperature of the system, describing the slope of the momentum distribution. Even when the total collision energy is shared among thousands of particles, the typical energy per particle remains in the range of a few GeV, with many low-momentum particles dominating the spectrum.\n\n\n\n\nThe typical energy scale for light, low-momentum particles is a few hundred GeV. The LHC has been highly productive in discovering new particles, particularly due to its high cross-section. The cross-section for electron-positron annihilation is much smaller than for proton-proton interactions, enabling the study of hadron production.\nThere are two main production mechanisms in collider processes:\n1. Prompt production: The particle of interest originates directly from the primary vertex.\n2. Cascade production: The particle decays weakly, producing a secondary vertex.\nFor example, the observation of the \\Omega_c baryon and the $_c^{(*)} $ states in prompt production has significantly impacted hadron spectroscopy. The cascade (\\Xi) particle, the ground state of the cascade multiplet, decays weakly since the charm or bottom quark is stable under strong interactions.\nThe lifetime of such weakly decaying particles is around `10^{-10}` seconds. If the particle is boosted to 100 GeV, it travels millimeters before decaying, allowing separation from the primary vertex. Ground states of charm or bottom hadrons typically displace by 5–6 millimeters.\nTo reconstruct the secondary vertex, charged particles (e.g., proton-kaon pairs) are combined from the thousands of produced particles. By looping over all kaon-proton (K\\pi) pairs and matching them with identified cascade decays, resonances produced at the primary vertex can be isolated. The mass spectrum of the \\Xi_c K system reveals clear peaks corresponding to these resonances.\n\\frac{dN}{dp_T} \\sim e^{-p_T / T}\nHere, `T` represents the characteristic temperature of the system, describing the exponential slope of the transverse momentum (`p_T`) distribution. Most particles have low momentum, with a tail extending to higher energies.\n\n[!NOTE]\nWeak decays of heavy-flavor hadrons (e.g., \\Xi_c) produce measurable secondary vertices, crucial for distinguishing them from prompt backgrounds.\n\n\n[!TIP]\nVertex resolution at the LHC is sufficient to resolve displacements as small as a few millimeters, enabling precise reconstruction of cascade decays.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the spectrum of the cascade \\Xi_c mass, you observe five distinct bumps. These correspond to the highest probability of producing a system, indicating resonant behavior at frequencies matching the excited states in the \\Omega_c model.\nThe \\Omega_c baryon is identified by counting strangeness: it contains two strange quarks ( `s` ) and one charm quark ( `c` ), denoted as `ssc`. In contrast, the cascade ( \\Xi_c ) is `suc`, and the kaon-nucleon ( `KN` ) system is `s\\bar{u}`.\nAnother approach involves studying secondary vertices from `B` decays. Ground-state hadrons with a `b` quark include `B` mesons and \\Lambda_b baryons. These are most easily produced via currents carrying the `b` quark. As ground states, they decay rapidly, with lifetimes on the order of `10^{-9}` seconds. However, when boosted, they produce secondary vertices several centimeters away from the primary interaction point.\nFor example, a displacement of two centimeters is observable in detectors, such as those at CERN. This flight distance separates the primary interaction vertex from the decay products, enabling clean kinematic reconstruction. By measuring the momentum of the `B` hadron and the decay length, you isolate its decay and study resonances within it.\nA prominent example is the decay \\Lambda_b \\to J/\\psi \\, p \\, K^-. This three-body decay allows analysis of exclusive final-state combinations ( `J/\\psi \\, p \\, K^-` ). The spectrum of the `pK^-` system shows bumps corresponding to \\Lambda resonances, while the `J/\\psi \\, p` spectrum reveals unexpected peaks. These peaks are attributed to pentaquark ( `P_c` ) resonances, specifically `u u g c \\bar{c}` combinations.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe \\Omega_c and \\Xi_c resonances are key to understanding the spectrum of charm-strange baryons, with their production and decay patterns offering insights into QCD dynamics.\n\n\n[!TIP]\nSecondary vertex analysis is crucial for isolating weakly decaying heavy-flavor hadrons, as their displaced decays reduce background contamination from prompt production.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe `u u g c \\bar{c}` combinations represent a resonance. Let’s briefly review fixed target experiments and their techniques, with three examples:\n\nGLUEX at Jefferson Lab: Uses a 9 GeV photon beam directed at a liquid hydrogen target, which provides protons as the interaction medium.\n\nCompass at CERN: Operates with a pion beam and also employs a liquid hydrogen target.\n\nCB-ELSA (corrected from “CD alpha tops”): Utilizes a photon beam at 2 GeV, focusing on light hadron spectroscopy rather than charm or bottom production.\n\nMost of these experiments study light hadrons, including pions and kaons. The GlueX experiment, in particular, investigates the same physics domain.\n\n[!NOTE]\nFixed target experiments like GlueX and Compass are optimized for precision measurements of light hadron spectra, leveraging controlled beam-target interactions.\n\n\n[!TIP]\nLiquid hydrogen targets are commonly used due to their purity and simplicity in providing proton targets for beam interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GlueX experiment is doing the same physics but with a different setup, beam type, and energy. CPL setups in Bonn are starting with rns, and it begins in the office.\nIt is important to realize that there are two different mechanisms involved in fixed-target experiments at intermediate energies. These are not TVs. The first process is diffraction, and the second is S-channel scattering. The process that occurs when two particles collide depends on the energy.\nIn diffraction, the proton acts as a source of the strong interaction field. Here, the proton emits gluons, serving as a source of gluonic fields. A pion or photon then interacts with these gluonic fields and becomes excited. The excited state (`X`) propagates briefly before decaying.\n\n\n\n\nThe excited state “flies” for a brief moment before decaying, though in reality, it doesn’t physically move far due to the strong interaction timescales. Hadronic resonances, particularly light ones in detectors, exist for times on the order of `10^{-25}` seconds, which is insufficient to displace them measurably from the primary vertex. However, we still represent them as separate particles in diagrams for clarity.\nIf the system’s energy is too high, resonances cannot form — there are no frequencies for the system to “resonate” at. The process becomes more plausible at lower energies, where a proton and an incoming beam (pion or photon) can resonate at specific frequencies. For instance, at energies around 2–3 GeV, this resonant interaction occurs.\nIn fixed-target kinematics, experiments like COMPASS study the diffractive regime, while CERN’s CPL focuses on `S`-channel production. These experiments probe baryonic excitations by analyzing resonance decays. The GlueX experiment at Jefferson Lab operates at 9 GeV, an intermediate energy where both diffractive and `S`-channel processes coexist, leading to coherent interference. Ideally, higher energies would isolate one process over the other, but at these scales, all possible interactions occur and must be accounted for.\n\n\n\n\nIn particle interactions, all possible kinematic configurations occur, and we must account for them. The setups and kinematics involve many intricate and interesting aspects that may be explored in future lectures.\nRegarding experiments, some are currently operational, while others are planned for the future. For example, the GlueX experiment is still running but is in its final years. There are proposals to upgrade it to “GlueX2” or a similar configuration, which would focus more on spectroscopy.\nA key question arises about the interaction mechanism in diagrams: is it direct or indirect gluon exchange? The answer lies in the color-neutral nature of the proton. Since a single gluon cannot maintain color neutrality, the proton emits a gluonic field instead. This field is color-neutral, and we describe the process as diffraction rather than simple gluon exchange.\nThe physical interpretation is as follows: the proton acts as a stationary source, emitting this gluonic field. The interaction resembles light scattering off an object, producing a diffractive pattern. The proton behaves like a “black disk,” and the resulting diffraction is observed. The exchanged entity — a collective state of gluon fields — is called the Pomeron.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe Pomeron is not a true particle and does not appear in the Particle Data Group (PDG) listings. It is a phenomenological construct used to describe the behavior of the gluon field in diffractive processes.\n\nThis process is not fully understood in terms of individual gluons but is well-established phenomenologically. The Pomeron represents the effective description of the gluon field’s role in diffraction.\n\n\n\n\nThe sum of momenta in an exclusive scattering process is given by:\n\\sum_i (\\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 + \\vec{p}_3 + ... - \\vec{p}_A - \\vec{p}_B) = \\sum_i \\sum_p \\sum_p \\sum_A\nThis represents the momentum balance between initial and final states.\nExclusive reactions are those where all particles are measured and accounted for, such as `1 \\to n` or `2 \\to n` processes. In contrast, inclusive processes involve unmeasured particles produced alongside the system of interest.\nTo count the kinematic variables describing such a process, we consider the four-momenta of all particles involved. Each particle has four components in its four-vector, but one constraint (mass-shell condition) reduces this to three independent components. For a `2 \\to 3` process, we have `5` particles (2 initial + 3 final), each contributing `3` independent momentum components, totaling `15` variables.\nWe then subtract the constraints from energy-momentum conservation, which imposes four delta functions (one for energy and three for momentum):\n\\delta^4 \\left( \\sum_{\\text{final}} p_i - \\sum_{\\text{initial}} p_j \\right)\nThis reduces the number of independent variables to `15 - 4 = 11` for a `2 \\to 3` process.\nThe interaction in such processes is often represented diagrammatically, where a “blob” denotes the interaction and lines represent incoming or outgoing particles. The Pomeron, a phenomenological construct, describes the collective gluon field in diffractive interactions, though it is not a true particle.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe Pomeron is color-neutral and represents the effective description of the gluon field’s role in diffraction, rather than a single gluon exchange.\n\nThis approach is well-established phenomenologically, even if the underlying gluon dynamics are not fully understood.\n\n\n\n\nFor a `2 \\to 3` process, we start with 15 variables (5 particles × 3 independent momentum components each). After accounting for energy-momentum conservation, we reduce this to `15 - 4 = 11` variables needed to describe the kinematics in any frame.\nWe can further reduce these degrees of freedom by choosing a specific frame. Fixing the frame eliminates 6 degrees of freedom: 3 for rotations and 3 for boosts.\nThe momentum balance is given by:\n\\sum_i (\\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 + \\vec{p}_3 + ... - \\vec{p}_A - \\vec{p}_B) = \\sum_i \\sum_p \\sum_p \\sum_A\n\n\n\n\nI’m going to lose six degrees of freedom: three for rotation and three for boosts. This gives the number of variables in this type of matrix.\nThe boost annotations are important to realize. The analogy is that you can think of the reaction block as a solid rigid bow with arrows sticking out. You can hold it in your hand, and this is essentially a rigid body.\nFor rigid bodies, there are three Euler rotations that describe the orientation of the body. These are exactly the three rotations you need to fix. You can think of it this way: for every event, for every set of kinematic variables, you can identify the length of the vectors and their mutual orientation.\nFor every set of kinematic variables, you could take a 3D printer and print it. These three rotations would then determine its orientation. In computations, these rotations are crucial for fixing the frame.\n\n\n\n\nIn computations, we often need the quantity that’s essential for calculating cross sections: the number of configurations the system can take. These configurations include not only the overall system’s orientation (three rotations and three boosts) but also the mutual orientations of the components.\nThe Lorentz-invariant phase space element counts the number of configurations for every particle in the final state. For each particle, the phase space element is:\nd\\rho = \\frac{d^4 p}{(2\\pi)^4} \\delta(p^2 - m^2)\nHere, `d^4 p` is the four-momentum volume element, and the delta function enforces the mass-shell condition. By integrating over the energy component, we obtain the familiar form:\n\\frac{d^3 p}{2E (2\\pi)^3}\nThe delta function ensures energy-momentum conservation, and we sum over all zeros of the delta function. To exclude negative-energy solutions, we include a theta function for energy:\n\\delta(p^2 - m^2) \\rightarrow \\delta(E^2 - \\vec{p}^2 - m^2) \\theta(E)\nEach delta function comes with a factor of `2\\pi`, which is straightforward to remember. The energy-momentum conservation constraint is implemented via:\n(2\\pi)^4 \\delta^4 \\left( \\sum_i p_i - P_{\\text{tot}} \\right)\nThis ensures the total four-momentum is conserved in the system.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe phase space element accounts for all possible kinematic configurations while respecting Lorentz invariance and energy-momentum conservation.\n\nThe rigid body analogy helps visualize this: for every set of kinematic variables, the system’s orientation is fixed by three Euler rotations, analogous to holding a rigid body in space. These rotations are crucial for defining the reference frame in computations.\n\n\n\n\nThe recursive evaluation of phase space is a straightforward concept, particularly when considering multi-particle systems. Here, we examine the case of a 4-body process. While the mathematical exercise of simplifying the integral is possible, it is not necessary to demonstrate explicitly that this complex integral reduces to a product of two-body phase spaces.\nThe diagram in question does not represent the dynamics of the process but rather operates with kinematic variables. The transition from 1 to 4 particles introduces additional degrees of freedom—specifically, 15 variables. When calculating phase space, we account for 3 integrals per particle, hence the factor of 3 in the phase space formula for each particle.\nThe initial state does not contribute to the phase space count; only the final state is considered. The four energy-momentum conservation laws are explicitly enforced, reducing the number of remaining integrals. Starting with 12 integrals (3 per particle for 4 particles), we subtract 4 for momentum conservation, leaving 8.\nThe remaining kinematic degrees of freedom include 5 variables for overall rotation (3 of which are finite Euler angles) and 3 boosts. The choice of these 5 variables is arbitrary and depends on the most convenient parameterization for calculating dynamics. The recursive approach does not prescribe specific interactions or reaction pathways—it is purely a kinematic parameterization.\nA common choice is to introduce intermediate mass variables, such as `x` and `y`, and express the phase space as:\nd\\rho = \\int \\frac{dM_x^2}{2\\pi} \\frac{dM_y^2}{2\\pi} \\cdot d\\rho_2(0 \\to y + 3)\nThis recursive expression is not limited to 2-body processes but can also be extended to 3-body cases. The key feature is the introduction of intermediate mass variables, over which we integrate. Each such integral includes a factor of `2\\pi` in the numerator.\nThe Lorentz-invariant phase space element for each particle is given by:\nd\\rho = \\frac{d^3 p_i}{2E_i (2\\pi)^3}\nand the overall conservation is enforced by:\n(2\\pi)^4 \\delta^4 \\left( \\sum_i \\vec{p}_i - \\vec{P}_{\\text{tot}} \\right)\nThis recursive decomposition simplifies the computation of multi-particle phase space while maintaining Lorentz invariance and energy-momentum conservation. The choice of kinematic variables remains flexible, tailored to the specific problem at hand.\n\n\n\n\nEvery integral in phase space comes with a `2\\pi` in the numerator. For example, introducing an intermediate state `Y` in the process `0 \\to Y + 4` and then `Y \\to 1 + 2 + 3` is a valid decomposition. Once you learn this trick, phase space calculations become straightforward because every 2-body phase space has the form:\nd\\rho_2 = \\frac{2p}{\\sqrt{s}} \\cdot \\frac{\\Omega}{4\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\nThis expression does not simplify further and represents a general feature of the 2-body phase space. We had an opportunity to derive this in class, but we did not complete it.\nThe Lorentz-invariant phase space for a single particle is given by:\nd\\rho = \\frac{d^3 p_i}{2E_i (2\\pi)^3}\nand the overall energy-momentum conservation is enforced by:\n(2\\pi)^4 \\delta^4 \\left( \\sum_i \\vec{p}_i - \\vec{P}_{\\text{tot}} \\right)\nThe recursive approach allows breaking down multi-particle phase space into simpler 2-body components, making calculations more manageable.\n\n\n\n\nWith the formula we derived, you can now calculate any `n`-body phase space. There is an exercise to explore the three-body phase space, which has `3 \\times 3 - 4 = 5` degrees of freedom, minus 3 for rotations, leaving only 2 variables. The distribution is often represented using these two variables, typically chosen as invariant masses. This representation is called the Dalitz plot.\nThe Lorentz-invariant phase space for a single particle is:\nd\\rho = \\frac{d^3 p_i}{2E_i (2\\pi)^3}\nand overall energy-momentum conservation is enforced by:\n(2\\pi)^4 \\delta^4 \\left( \\sum_i \\vec{p}_i - \\vec{P}_{\\text{tot}} \\right)\nThe recursive approach simplifies multi-particle phase space calculations by breaking them into 2-body components.\n\n\n\n\nThe representation is called Dalitz plot. Hope to get the book next time. Let’s have a round of questions for a minute. I won’t have an exercise tonight. Any questions? Have you seen this before? That’s really good, because these computations are not complicated, but they give you a lot of insight into how things work. Thanks for coming today, and don’t forget to leave feedback sheets.\nThis week we will not have exercises. Next week, would Wednesday or Friday work for you?"

Before diving into that, let’s recap the last lecture and address two key questions:\n\nCompute the magnetic moment in the current model of the Omega baryon.\n\nCompute the lowest `1s` multiplet excitation of the `\\Sigma_p` parameter (related to ISIS spin factors).\n\nFor question 1, we first need the quark content of the `\\Omega^-` baryon: three strange quarks (`sss`). The total wave function is a product of color, isospin, spin, and flavor components, but color and isospin are factored out, leaving only flavor and spin. The flavor part is trivial, so we focus on spin.\nThe spin configuration must yield a total spin of `3/2` for the `\\Omega^-` baryon, with parity `+`. This implies orbital angular momentum `L = 1`, and the spin must be `1/2` to achieve the correct total angular momentum `J = 3/2`.\nFor question 2, the `1s` multiplet excitation of `\\Sigma_p` involves understanding the spin structure of the system, particularly how the spin states align to form the lowest-energy configuration.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe `\\Omega^-` baryon’s magnetic moment arises from the contributions of its three strange quarks, each with spin `1/2`. The total spin configuration must be symmetric to match the observed `J = 3/2` state.\n\n\n[!TIP]\nWhen computing the `1s` multiplet, remember that the lowest-energy state corresponds to the most symmetric spin arrangement, minimizing repulsive interactions."

Energy scan: By tuning the beam energy over weeks, we measure the cross section at discrete points, building a profile of the resonance structure.\nThe total cross section is a superposition of all possible sub-processes, such as e^+e^- \\to \\text{hadrons}. Some resonances are more prominent in specific decay kinematics, so researchers often analyze a particular final state (e.g., e^+e^- \\to 3\\pi) at a selected scan point to extract hadron properties.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe cross section enhancement follows the Breit-Wigner distribution:\n\n\\sigma(E) \\sim \\frac{\\Gamma^2/4}{(E - E_{\\text{res}})^2 + \\Gamma^2/4}\nwhere `\\Gamma` is the resonance width and `E_{\\text{res}}` is the resonance energy.\nThe J/\\psi and \\Upsilon families provide clean signatures for studying quarkonium spectroscopy due to their well-defined quantum numbers (1^-) and relativistic production mechanisms.

    "text": "The BEL2 experiment in Japan was originally designed with the primary goal of studying CP violation, but its data proved extremely valuable for hadron spectroscopy as well. This experiment operates as an electron-positron collider and is located at KEK. It was initially called the Belle experiment, and after an upgrade 10 years ago, it became known as the SuperKEKB experiment. The predecessor was called Belle, and the upgraded version is referred to as Belle II.\nIn contrast to the Belle experiment, the colliding beams in Belle II are not symmetric. The center-of-mass energy is adjusted to a specific resonance, primarily to study B mesons and CP violation. The experiment operates at the `\\Upsilon(4S)` resonance, which predominantly decays into a `B\\bar{B}` pair.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nThe `\\Upsilon(4S)` is a short-lived resonance that decays immediately, leaving the primary vertex and producing a `B\\bar{B}` pair. The physics of CP violation is then studied using these decays.\n\nA key question is why the beam energies are asymmetric. This design choice is deliberate and clever. By giving the electron and positron beams different energies, the entire system receives a boost when produced. This boost is in the direction of the higher-energy beam (the electron beam) due to energy conservation.\nThe boost has a significant effect on the B mesons:\n- The B mesons gain a substantial longitudinal momentum.\n- They live longer in the laboratory frame due to relativistic time dilation.\n- They travel farther from the primary vertex before decaying.\nThis increased flight distance is crucial for precise vertex reconstruction. By measuring the displacement between the primary vertex and the decay point (secondary vertex), we can better identify and reconstruct B meson decays. The charged tracks from these decays do not point back to the primary vertex, providing a clear signature of secondary vertices.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe boost effect can be quantified using relativistic kinematics. The Lorentz factor `\\gamma` and the velocity `\\beta` determine the observed lifetime `\\tau_{\\text{lab}}` in the lab frame:\n\n\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau_0, \\quad \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m}, \\quad \\beta = \\frac{p}{E}\nwhere `\\tau_0` is the proper lifetime, `E` is the energy, `m` is the mass, and `p` is the momentum of the B meson.\nThis technique enhances our ability to separate signal from background and improves the precision of CP violation measurements. Before moving away from Belle II, let me connect this back to what we discussed earlier."

The mass difference between the `\\eta_b` and the vector bottomonium state ( `\\Upsilon` ) is reduced compared to charmonium.\nThe energy scale between levels remains roughly the same (a few hundred MeV), but within each multiplet, the states are more tightly packed.

The notation `4s` refers to the fourth excited state in the bottomonium spectrum, arising from the `4 \\times` acceleration of the spectrum. When scanning the energy, the states appear sequentially: first the `\\Upsilon(1s)`, then `\\Upsilon(2s)`, `\\Upsilon(3s)`, and finally `\\Upsilon(4s)`.\nAll these states lie above the threshold for `B`-meson production, with masses exceeding 9 GeV. For example, the `\\Upsilon(1s)` has a mass around 9.46 GeV, while higher states like `\\Upsilon(4s)` are even heavier.\nProton-proton collisions are significantly more complex than electron-positron annihilations. The multiplicity of particles produced in such collisions is very high, increasing with energy. At the LHC, with proton beams at 7.7 TeV, the collisions are symmetric. However, since these are not annihilation processes, the produced particles are typically boosted due to the initial quark and gluon interactions.\nThe typical multiplicity of particles produced in a single proton-proton collision is on the order of thousands. The transverse momentum (`p_T`) spectrum follows an exponential distribution, with most particles at low momentum and a tail extending to higher energies. The typical energy scale for particles in these collisions is hundreds of GeV, though individual particle energies can range from tens to hundreds of GeV.\n\\frac{dN}{dp_T} \\sim e^{-p_T / T}\nHere, `T` represents the characteristic temperature of the system, describing the slope of the momentum distribution.

The LHC has been highly productive in discovering new particles, particularly due to its high cross-section. The cross-section for electron-positron annihilation is much smaller than for proton-proton interactions, enabling the study of hadron production.\nThere are two main production mechanisms in collider processes:\n1. Prompt production: The particle of interest originates directly from the primary vertex.\n2. Cascade production: The particle decays weakly, producing a secondary vertex.\nFor example, the observation of the \\Omega_c baryon and the $_c^{(*)} $ states in prompt production has significantly impacted hadron spectroscopy. The cascade (\\Xi) particle, the ground state of the cascade multiplet, decays weakly since the charm or bottom quark is stable under strong interactions.\nThe lifetime of such weakly decaying particles is around `10^{-10}` seconds. If the particle is boosted to 100 GeV, it travels millimeters before decaying, allowing separation from the primary vertex. Ground states of charm or bottom hadrons typically displace by 5–6 millimeters.\nTo reconstruct the secondary vertex, charged particles (e.g., proton-kaon pairs) are combined from the thousands of produced particles.

In contrast, the cascade ( \\Xi_c ) is `suc`, and the kaon-nucleon ( `KN` ) system is `s\\bar{u}`.\nAnother approach involves studying secondary vertices from `B` decays.

However, we still represent them as separate particles in diagrams for clarity.\nIf the system’s energy is too high, resonances cannot form — there are no frequencies for the system to “resonate” at. The process becomes more plausible at lower energies, where a proton and an incoming beam (pion or photon) can resonate at specific frequencies. For instance, at energies around 2–3 GeV, this resonant interaction occurs.\nIn fixed-target kinematics, experiments like COMPASS study the diffractive regime, while CERN’s CPL focuses on `S`-channel production. These experiments probe baryonic excitations by analyzing resonance decays. The GlueX experiment at Jefferson Lab operates at 9 GeV, an intermediate energy where both diffractive and `S`-channel processes coexist, leading to coherent interference.

There are proposals to upgrade it to “GlueX2” or a similar configuration, which would focus more on spectroscopy.\nA key question arises about the interaction mechanism in diagrams: is it direct or indirect gluon exchange? The answer lies in the color-neutral nature of the proton. Since a single gluon cannot maintain color neutrality, the proton emits a gluonic field instead. This field is color-neutral, and we describe the process as diffraction rather than simple gluon exchange.\nThe physical interpretation is as follows: the proton acts as a stationary source, emitting this gluonic field. The interaction resembles light scattering off an object, producing a diffractive pattern. The proton behaves like a “black disk,” and the resulting diffraction is observed. The exchanged entity — a collective state of gluon fields — is called the Pomeron.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe Pomeron is not a true particle and does not appear in the Particle Data Group (PDG) listings.

This marks a shift in the course, where we transition from overlapping topics with particle physics to material specific to hadron spectroscopy. One key subject we will explore is particle representation, particularly in three-body decays.\nThe Dalitz plot is a common technique to study the dynamics of interactions in such decays. For a three-body decay, the diagram involves one incoming leg and three outgoing legs, with the “blob” representing the interaction. The number of kinematic variables remains the same as before, determined by the number of legs.\nFor decays like `3\\pi` or `DDK`, two variables fully describe the process. Given these two variables—whether `S` and `T`, angles, or others—the entire kinematics can be reconstructed. Think of it like a rigid body: if you 3D-print a blob with fixed vectors sticking out, the angles and lengths of the vectors are fixed, defining the kinematic configuration. The same applies to a three-body decay—just two variables are needed to visualize the decay in the center-of-mass frame.\nThe variables `S`, `T`, and `U` are examples of invariants used to describe the process.

This transformation introduces a Jacobian, though the speaker notes uncertainty about its exact form.\nThe recursive formula for three-body phase space reveals that the Jacobian for transforming to paired mass variables (e.g., `m_{23}^2`, `m_{24}^2`) is constant. This means the differential width or cross section, when plotted against these variables, shows no additional density variations. The choice of Mandelstam variables (or linearly related ones) is particularly powerful because they provide an undistorted representation of the interaction dynamics.\nFor example, plotting the differential width against `m_{34}^2` or `m_{23}^2` yields a constant density, reflecting the underlying physics without kinematic distortions.

In this setup, the proton and the kaon (`K`) go in opposite directions, which corresponds to the maximum mass of the `K` system. For this configuration, the lengths of all vectors are fixed, and only rotation is possible.\nThe mass dependence of two particles can be expressed as a function of the angle between them: the wider the angle, the larger the mass. For the proton-kaon system, when the angle is zero, the mass is very high. When the particles move almost in the same direction, their mass is small. The same logic applies to the other half of the system.\nThe most straightforward way to analyze this is to work in the rest frame of the proton-kaon system, where all momenta are fixed. By scanning along this line, we change the angle of the pair relative to the rest frame. This describes the setup where the angle is varied in one frame or another.\nThere is a third variable in the `2 \\to 2` scattering process, called `U`, which introduces additional symmetry. For a three-particle system (pion, proton, kaon), the mass of the pion-proton pair is not immediately evident. If we fix the mass of this system and scan the angle, the motion along the line is determined by the relation:\nU = m_{\\pi p}^2 + m_{K p}^2 + m_{K \\pi}^2 - \\text{const.}\nHere, `U` is a linear combination of the other two mass variables, with coefficients of one. This results in a diagonal line in the Dalitz plot. Fixing the mass of the pion-proton system corresponds to moving along this diagonal, transitioning from one corner to another.\nThe standard experimental representation of a Dalitz plot places the mass of one pair on the `x`-axis and the mass of another pair on the `y`-axis. However, a more symmetric representation exists, where all variables are treated equally. This uses the properties of an equilateral triangle: for any point inside, the sum of the distances to the sides is constant.\nIn this symmetric representation, the masses of the particles correspond to the distances to the sides of the equilateral triangle. This allows for a fully symmetric treatment of the variables, where the masses are summed in a balanced way. The transformation between the standard and symmetric representations is not just a rotation but a skew, involving a linear transformation.\nThe relation between Cartesian coordinates and the heights of the equilateral triangle involves a factor of `\\sqrt{3}/2` due to the 60-degree angles. This symmetric representation is elegant, but the standard representation is more practical for plotting, as it avoids the need for this transformation. Both methods fully describe the kinematics of the system."

In future lectures, we will see that the decay process is not just `\\Lambda_C \\to 3` particles but proceeds via intermediate resonances. For a short moment, two particles form an intermediate state that dissociates, increasing the decay probability.\nWhen the energy is adjusted into a certain range, the probability for this process becomes higher because the particles interact more strongly. This is analogous to hadronic resonances in two-particle cross sections, where a “bump” appears. The physics behind this is that the quantum numbers of the two-particle system match those of an intermediate resonance. By tuning the system’s energy, we observe how likely the particles are to interact at that energy.\nIf an intermediate resonance exists, the system can resonate at this energy, leading to a probability increase as it passes through the resonance region. This manifests as an enhancement in the decay rate.\nThe mass dependence of two particles can be expressed as a function of the angle between them: the wider the angle, the larger the mass. For example, in a proton-kaon system, when the angle is zero, the mass is very high, while particles moving in nearly the same direction have a small mass.\nThe most straightforward analysis is done in the rest frame of the proton-kaon system, where all momenta are fixed. By scanning along this line, we vary the angle of the pair relative to the rest frame.\nIn `2 \\to 2` scattering, a third variable `U` introduces additional symmetry. For a three-particle system (pion, proton, kaon), the mass of the pion-proton pair is not immediately evident. Fixing this mass and scanning the angle determines the motion along the line:\nU = m_{\\pi p}^2 + m_{K p}^2 + m_{K \\pi}^2 - \\text{const.}\nHere, `U` is a linear combination of the other two mass variables, resulting in a diagonal line in the Dalitz plot. Fixing the mass of the pion-proton system corresponds to moving along this diagonal.\nThe standard experimental Dalitz plot places one pair mass on the `x`-axis and another on the `y`-axis. However, a symmetric representation treats all variables equally, using the properties of an equilateral triangle. In this form, the masses correspond to distances to the sides of the triangle, allowing a balanced treatment. The transformation between representations involves a skew, not just a rotation.\nThe relation between Cartesian coordinates and the heights of the equilateral triangle includes a factor of `\\sqrt{3}/2` due to the 60-degree angles. While the symmetric representation is elegant, the standard form is more practical for plotting."

After identifying a particle as a “bump” in the spectrum, the next step is to determine its properties, including quantum numbers, by analyzing angular distributions. This is often as simple as examining the Dalitz plot and checking for minima or structures in the angular distribution.\nThe presence of nodes in the angular distribution directly indicates the spin of the particle if the final state consists of scalar particles.

For non-scalar particles, which are most interacting particles, the situation is more complicated. Here, scalar resonances serve as an example.\nThe spin of a proton is `\\frac{1}{2}`, and the spin of `K^+` and `\\pi` is zero since they are scalars. The spin of `\\Lambda` is the same as the proton, but the presence of spin averages out the distribution. If you consider a specific spin projection of `\\Lambda_c` and the proton, you would observe nodes and zeros in the angular distribution. However, since we neither polarize the initial state `\\Lambda` nor measure the spin of the final state, everything is averaged, and the minima or nodes disappear.\nA particle with spin `J` can have `2J + 1` projections onto the quantization axis. Consider a particle with spin `J` and a `z`-axis for spin quantization. The operator `J_z` acting on the state `|Jm\\rangle` yields:\nJ_z |Jm\\rangle = m |Jm\\rangle\nThe state `|Jm\\rangle` can be represented as a vector with `2J + 1` components. Operators in this space are matrices that act on these vectors, either returning the same state with an eigenvalue or producing a mixture of states.\nWhen a rotation is applied to the state, it does not simply adjust to a new projection as in classical vectors. Instead, quantum mechanics dictates that the rotated state becomes a superposition of all possible states:\nR(\\theta) |Jm\\rangle = \\sum_{m'} D^{(J)}_{m'm}(\\theta) |Jm'\\rangle\nHere, `D^{(J)}_{m'm}(\\theta)` are the Wigner rotation matrices, which describe how the state mixes under rotation.

These coefficients depend on the initial state, hence the `JM` indices are retained in the notation.\nFor example, consider a spin-1 state initially perpendicular to the `Y`-axis and rotated by 30 degrees. The resulting state composition can be determined by looking up these Wigner D coefficients.\nTo perform a rotation about the `Y`-axis, we use the `J_y` operator, which has zeros on the diagonal and coefficients above and below the diagonal. The transformation is applied via the matrix exponential `e^{-iJ_y \\theta}`, but the Wigner D functions already encapsulate this result.\nA more general rotation in 3D space is described using Euler angles. In particle physics, the convention is:\n1. Rotate by `\\phi` about the `Z`-axis.\n2. Rotate by `\\theta` about the `Y`-axis.\n3. Rotate by `\\gamma` about the `Z`-axis again.\nThe Wigner D function for this full rotation decomposes into three parts:\nD^J_{m'm}(\\gamma, \\theta, \\phi) = e^{-i\\gamma m'} d^J_{m'm}(\\theta) e^{-i\\phi m}\nThe most nontrivial part is the middle rotation about `Y`, while the `Z`-rotations introduce phase factors.\nFor a concrete example, take a spin-`\\frac{1}{2}` state `|\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\rangle` and rotate it by 30 degrees about `Y`.

For those who missed the CERN excursion, it was a lot of fun. We heard about your cheese obsession—apparently, it’s partly true. Everyone was obsessed, and we even discussed the rules for fondue. The 25th of May is the last day for fondue, so we were still within the legal limit.\nIf you want to work on something before tomorrow, you still have time. However, none of you handed in the last homework. Was it too difficult, or did you just not attend the lectures?\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nCheck your emails on Moodle for homework links. Even if you don’t solve them, at least read and think about the problems.\n\nI was sick last week and couldn’t attend, but I hope you received my emails. It’s important to stay updated.\nRegarding the kinematics exercise with unlabeled Dalitz plots, the goal is to deduce the masses and identify the decays. Each group will analyze one plot and then exchange it for another.\n\n[!NOTE]\nMartin Spearman’s Elementary Particle Theory (Chapter 4) provides a framework for understanding particle definitions, including helicity and canonical states, which is useful for interpreting kinematic distributions like Dalitz plots.\n\n\n## Lecture Logistics and Online Resources\n\nIf you don’t handle the problems, just look and appreciate them. It’s important to attend the lectures, especially at the beginning, where we have a recap.  \n\nThese are typical problems from exercise sheet four—the last one we discussed. Today’s sheet is five, and the previous one (sheet four) included the triangle Dalitz plots.  \n\n&gt; [!NOTE]  \n&gt; Despite receiving exercise sheets during lectures, it’s useful to check them online for updates, as some links or corrections may be posted."

    "text": "31 Feasibility of Strong Interaction Studies in Lattice QCD\nThe examples shown so far involve weak interactions, but the question is whether similar studies can be done for strong interactions using Lattice QCD.\nCurrently, Lattice QCD uses a different approach—it can handle isolated scattering of two particles but cannot yet compute densities. For instance, the decay of a `D` meson or `A_1` meson into three particles is not feasible on the lattice. This is because such processes involve ill-defined questions on the lattice, which primarily works with correlation functions.\nHowever, there is active development in this direction, particularly for three-body kinematics in Lattice QCD. This is a highly researched area, and progress is being made. For a master’s thesis, exploring these topics could be valuable, though they may appear both complicated and conceptually simple at first glance.\nJohn Bulawa is a key researcher in this field and could provide guidance on potential thesis work. The methods and problems in Lattice QCD are evolving, making it an exciting area for new students to contribute."

Consider the coordinate axes: `X`, `Y`, and `Z`, with the particle moving in the `XZ` direction. There are two ways to quantize spin in this scenario:\n\nHelicity basis: Quantize spin along the direction of motion.\n\nCanonical basis: Quantize spin along the `Z`-axis.\n\nThese two bases are not equivalent but are related.

Immediately think of it as the combination of boost and rotation operators acting on the canonical states in the rest frame.\nThere are many properties we can derive for helicity states. One worth mentioning is that when you rotate a helicity state, only the momentum rotates—the helicity stays the same. If you apply further rotations, the momentum continues to rotate, but the spin remains quantized along the direction of motion, preserving the helicity value. This is evident from how the state is constructed.\nIf you introduce a rotation here (multiplying by a rotation operator), you can combine the rotations into a single one, affecting only the momentum during the boost. Boosting is trickier because when you boost this state, you insert a boost operator `B` (here, `B_z`). For any combination of boosts and rotations (`B R B^{-1}`), you can find equivalent pure rotations.\nWhen you evaluate this and rotate the canonical state (using the inverse operation), you obtain a combination of coefficients `C_{\\lambda'}`, yielding the helicity state. Applying boosts and rotations to this gives you back a helicity state.\nThe most demanding part of this exercise is finding the relation between the boosted/rotated states and the original helicity basis.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe Wigner D functions describe how states transform under rotation.

The key remaining task is to understand the composition of spin projection and directional motion. Clearly, we have a linear combination of different projections—not just a single one.\nIntuitively, if you start with a vector and boost it, the vector becomes more inclined forward. Instead of boosting twice, you can boost only once to achieve the same final momentum magnitude. This is captured in the relation between boost and rotation operations.\nFor example, applying a boost `B_z` to a particle at rest directly produces the desired momentum.

I inserted `R'^{-1} R'` here, combined these matrices, and now this gives me the canonical state when applied to the state at rest. The remaining step is to apply the rotation accelerator to the state at rest, which is described by the `D` functions acting on this state. Therefore, the result is a sum over coefficients `C`. After applying `R`, I obtain a linear combination with coefficients `C`, and for each state, I act with the inverse boost rotation to get a canonical state. Now, this is a projection labeled with `\\lambda'`, and I have a linear combination of them.\nThe momentum `P` also changes because the angle is rotated. The rotated momentum is `P' = R' R P_z`, where `P_z` is the momentum after boosting along the `z`-axis. After the boost, the momentum becomes non-zero, and applying the rotation `R'` gives `P'`.\nNow, let’s discuss the relation between the helicity state and the canonical state. The helicity state `|p, j, \\lambda\\rangle` can be expressed as a linear combination of canonical states `|p, j, m\\rangle_{\\text{canonical}}`. The coefficients for this transformation are determined by applying the inverse rotation `R^{-1}` to the state. The key operation is `R B R^{-1}`, which converts the state into a canonical form, and then applying `R` to this state gives the desired linear combination.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe helicity state is defined by boosting to the rest frame and then rotating. The angle of decay in this frame, measured relative to the direction of motion, is called the helicity angle.\n\nReturning to the example of `\\Lambda` decay, consider a `\\Lambda` moving in the lab frame. To define the `z`-axis in the helicity frame, we boost to the rest frame of the `\\Lambda` and use its direction of motion in the lab frame. This defines the helicity frame for `\\Lambda`. The helicity angle is then the angle of decay measured relative to this `z`-axis.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nThe helicity frame depends on the reference frame from which the boost is performed. Different frames will result in different rest-frame orientations of the particle.\n\nThe helicity frame is always defined as the rest frame of the particle obtained by boosting from the frame where it was moving. The helicity angle is a standard term in hadron physics, referring to the angle measured in this boosted rest frame."

This is our recap exercise. Initially, we started with only one axis, but now we have a plane with an additional variable on which the amplitude depends, in addition to the two discrete variables. This variable is the scattering angle or the helicity angle.\nThe final state here will be frozen binary. On the right side, we have configurations of `\\Lambda` sitting in its rest frame with the proton in `\\Lambda`. On the left side, we have this configuration of the pion-proton system. The way to proceed is to apply rotation to this configuration and align it back.\nThe answer for this is:\nH_{\\lambda p} = T_{\\Lambda \\lambda}\nThis equation describes the matrix element for the sequence of decays. To derive it, we apply the transition operator `T` on the final state. The goal is to simplify this expression. Here, `T` acts on the proton state.\nWe want to evaluate the application of the transition operator that takes the pion-proton system and transforms it into `\\Lambda`. This is the meaning of our operator. When this operator acts on the pion-proton state with momentum `\\vec{P} = (0, 0, P_z)`, we notice that it is rotated about the `y`-axis by an angle `\\theta`.\nWe want to align this to the left state, which has aligned combinations. Thus, we perform a rotation, pull out the outer rotation, and obtain the same combination along the `z`-axis. The proton moves forward, time goes backward, and the rotation is made explicit.\nSince these operators commute and strong interactions conserve spin, we can compute the transition operator and rotation separately. We first apply the transition operator and then the rotation. Essentially, the transition operator transforms the pion-proton system into `\\Lambda`, and we explicitly perform this operation.\nThe plane is defined by three vectors:\n1.

    "text": "14 Parity Violation in Polarized Lambda Decay\nThe transition operator transforms the pion-proton problem to the lambda system. We explicitly do this by inserting the identity state here. Here, we have a lambda state for the light statement. This part is a path lambda problem, and it gives us just the state of the lambda with the same speed.\nThe matrix element we just evaluated is simply the lambda coupling. If we insert the identity, it should account for all possible combinations. Therefore, that would be a sum over lambda states. This will give us delta functions for the lambda lambda problem, allowing us to isolate a single state.\nThe final step is to apply rotation to the system. It’s good to see this once, but once you understand the idea, it becomes clear that in the case of the cascade reaction, each transition involves the product of the block helicity amplitude (the transition matrix element for the aligned transition) and the rotation.\nNow, the differential cross section depends on the angle as a function of the scattering angle. The equation involves cosine and sine matrices:\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta \\\\\n\\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta\n\\end{pmatrix}\nFor the spin matrix, we have an explicit numerical form, and we have two coupling constants measured in experiments. These can be used to compute the angular distribution.\nThe result is the same as before because:\n\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1\nThis term appears in front of the first component, while the second component has:\n-\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta\nThis simplifies to another trivial result.\nFrom this exercise, we learn that if we start with an unpolarized particle, we will not observe any interesting angular distribution. We sum over final states and initial states, and no non-trivial angle distributions remain for the `2\\pi DDK` system before integrating over the full phase space.\nThe phase space integral is:\n\\int \\frac{d\\Omega}{4\\pi} = \\int \\frac{d\\cos \\theta}{2} \\int \\frac{d\\phi}{2\\pi}\nThis is a standard phase space measure.\nNow, let’s consider the case of polarized decay. Here, we obtain non-trivial distributions if the particle is polarized. Suppose the lambda particle is flying with a definite spin projection along its momentum direction, say `+1/2`. When it decays, we find that the proton is more likely to travel forward than backward.\nThis angle dependence of the proton’s momentum violates parity. Applying parity to the initial and final states flips the momentum but not the spin. The final configuration under parity would require the proton to be more likely backward, which contradicts the original observation.\nThis confirms that parity is violated in this decay process. This is consistent with the fact that weak interactions, which govern this decay, do not conserve parity. The asymmetry in the angular distribution directly demonstrates this violation."

This reduces the observed asymmetry.\nThe differential decay width can be written as:\nd\\Gamma = \\Gamma_0 (1 + \\alpha P \\cos \\theta)\nHere, `\\alpha` is the analyzing power, which quantifies how well the decay reflects the initial polarization. If the couplings are equal, `\\alpha = 0`, and the decay is insensitive to polarization. However, for most weak decays, `\\alpha \\neq 0`, allowing the angular distribution to reveal parity violation.\nThe asymmetry in the proton emission angle confirms parity violation.

For example, take `\\sqrt{X}` and place it in the expression. This constructs a special function `F(X)` whose imaginary part equals `\\sqrt{X}` in the region from `-1` to `7`. Outside this interval, the function is non-zero but has no singularities.\nThe construction introduces non-trivial analytic structures. Three candidates for these structures are:\n1.

The distinction lies in whether the function diverges (poles) or simply changes value discontinuously (cuts).

This is the energy range where such formations would be searched for.\nFor quantum numbers, we have spin-parity combinations of `1/2^-` and `3/2^-` due to the `S`-wave reference. This implies two expected states: one with spin-parity `1/2^-` and another with `3/2^-`.\nThere is a lower bound on the lifetime of this particle, which arises from the binding of its constituents. The decay of this particle must conserve energy. In the rest frame of the particle, the total energy available is just its mass. Since the `P_c^+` is below the threshold for strong decay into `\\Sigma_c^+` and `D^0`, it cannot decay that way.\nThe possible decay channels are:\n1. Electromagnetic annihilation of the `c\\bar{c}` pair, but this is highly suppressed because electromagnetic processes are much weaker than other interactions.\n2. Strong annihilation of the `c\\bar{c}` pair into lighter quarks, but this is also suppressed for heavy quarks like charm.

When two stable particles combine, the resulting bound state can live indefinitely. For example, the deuteron is made of a proton and a neutron. While the proton is stable and the neutron has a long lifetime, the deuteron itself is stable because the neutron is so tightly bound inside that its decay is suppressed.\nThe binding mechanism suppresses the phase space available for decay, thereby increasing the particle’s lifetime. For instance, a `D` meson in a bound state would live longer than an isolated `D^*` meson. The width `\\Gamma` of the bound state is smaller than the width of the `D`, and since the lifetime `\\tau` is inversely proportional to the width:\n\\tau \\propto \\frac{1}{\\Gamma}\nthe bound state has a longer lifetime.\nA similar effect occurs with the `\\Sigma_c^* D` system. Instead of fully dissociating, it may transition to a lower energy state, such as `\\Sigma_c D \\pi` or `\\Sigma_c D \\gamma`, though this requires significant energy. The binding energy and suppression of decays are actively researched topics, with frequent discussions at conferences.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nThe suppression of decay channels due to binding energy leads to longer-lived states, as seen in deuteron and certain mesonic systems.

Similarly, `t` is the mass squared of the system with particles B and C, and `u` is the mass squared of the system with particles A and C.\n\n[!NOTE]\nOnly two variables are needed to fully characterize the kinematics of a four-particle process, due to counting degrees of freedom.

This amplitude is defined on the plane of kinematic variables, with different domains corresponding to different physical processes.\nTo analyze the kinematics, we examine the signs of `s`, `t`, and `u`. If the mass squared of a two-particle system is physical (i.e., `s &gt; 0`), it represents a realizable state. If unphysical (e.g., `t &lt; 0` or `u &lt; 0`), it depends on the exact masses of the particles to determine the allowed kinematic ranges.\nFor example, in a scattering process, `s &gt; 0` typically corresponds to the center-of-mass energy squared, while `t &lt; 0` or `u &lt; 0` may describe momentum transfer in a spacelike regime. The exact placement of kinematic boundaries requires evaluating the masses of the involved particles.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nThe Mandelstam variables `s`, `t`, and `u` are not independent — only two are needed to describe the kinematics of a four-particle reaction.

To discuss the kinematics of cross-channel reactions using the same variables, one must modify the definition of the environments by swapping momenta to minus momenta for particles moving to the other side.\nAs mentioned earlier, you could define the directions in two different ways, and the minus signs would appear in the first place. The physical region for this case occurs when `T &gt; 0`, since `T` represents the squared mass of two particles. In this scenario, `S` corresponds to particles `A` and `B`, but this becomes an impossible combination if they are on different sides, leading to `S &lt; 0` and `U &lt; 0`.\nThe kinematic domain is roughly where `U &lt; 0`, `S &gt; 0`, and `T &gt; 0`.

For instance, the same matrix element describes:\n- Compton scattering (photon-electron → photon-electron)\n- Electron-positron annihilation into two photons\n- Two-photon production of an electron-positron pair\nIn hadron physics, however, the situation is more complicated due to the lack of a perturbative framework.

    "text": "15 Derivation of the Unitarity Condition\nThe unitarity condition constrains our scattering amplitude. To see this, we start from the condition and derive the constraints on `T`. The approach involves manipulating the expression `1 - (1 + iT)(1 - iT^\\dagger)`.\nLet’s verify the algebra:\n- The term `(1 + iT)(1 - iT^\\dagger)` expands to `1 - iT^\\dagger + iT + T T^\\dagger`.\n- Subtracting this from `1` gives `i(T - T^\\dagger) + T T^\\dagger`.\n- Multiplying both sides by `i` shifts the minus sign to `T^\\dagger` and removes the `i` on the left, yielding:\nT - T^\\dagger = i T T^\\dagger\nNow, we insert the final state and introduce the identity operator to split it into intermediate states. The key step is inserting a complete set of intermediate states, which includes all possible momentum configurations of the intermediate particles (with fixed energy). This requires integrating over the intermediate momentum:\n\\langle f | T - T^\\dagger | i \\rangle = i \\sum_m \\langle f | T^\\dagger | m \\rangle \\langle m | T | i \\rangle \\frac{d^3 p^{(m)}}{(2 \\pi)^3 2 E_m}\nHere, the delta functions enforce energy-momentum conservation:\n- The first delta function connects the initial state to the intermediate state: `P_1 + P_2 = P_1^{(m)} + P_2^{(m)}`.\n- The second delta function connects the intermediate state to the final state: `P_1' + P_2' = P_1^{(m)} + P_2^{(m)}`.\nBy isolating the delta function that relates the initial and final states, we simplify the phase space integral to:\n\\int \\delta^{(4)}(P_1 + P_2 - P_1' - P_2') \\, d^4 p^{(m)}\nThis leads us to the unitarity constraint for the scattering amplitude:\nT - T^\\dagger = i \\int T^\\dagger T \\, d\\Phi\nwhere `d\\Phi` is the phase space measure. This equation ensures that the probability is conserved, reflecting the unitarity of the `S`-matrix.\nThe scattering operator `S` must satisfy `S S^\\dagger = I`, where `S = 1 + iT`. The non-trivial part of the amplitude is encoded in `T`, which is isolated by subtracting the identity. This constraint is critical for restricting partial waves and the form of the scattering amplitude `A(s, t)`.\nFor distinguishable scalar particles, there is no cross-term if `P_1' = P_2`. The probability statement is about the full scattering operator being unitary, with `T` representing the interaction part beyond the identity."

    "text": "16 Partial Wave Expansion and Its Properties\nWe arrive at the first equation:\nT - T^\\dagger = i \\int T^\\dagger T \\, d\\Phi\nThe most general form of this equation, without any constraints, is very similar. Instead of integrating over two-body phase space, you must sum over all intermediate states and integrate over `n`-body phase space if `n`-body processes are allowed. Diagrammatically, this means the amplitude minus its conjugate must equal the sum over all intermediate states, with integration over all possible configurations.\nInstead of working with momentum and energy variables, we can simplify the problem by using angles. A function of angle can be approximated by partial waves, which is a convenient series because it converges well, especially in low-energy physics.\nThere are constraints on these amplitudes: they cannot be large for high angular momentum `j` due to a natural suppression related to the size of hadrons. Contributions from high `j` values are small, which is why experiments often require only a few partial waves—two, three, sometimes six, but rarely more than ten. This makes partial wave expansion a very practical approximation.\n\n[!NOTE]\nIf the sum is taken to infinity (as in Regge theory), the relation becomes exact.\n\nAnother key feature is the partial wave amplitude, which is a function of a single variable. For each partial wave, there is one such function, and each has fixed quantum numbers. A major advantage of partial waves is that they do not influence each other—they are effectively decoupled."

    "text": "17 Partial Wave Unitarity and Phase Space Relations\nPartial waves do not interact with each other—they are decoupled. Since quantum numbers in scattering are conserved, partial waves in the initial state are only related to partial waves in the final state. The unitarity constraint reveals that each partial wave relates only to its own output, with no mixing between different partial waves.\nTo proceed, we insert the following relation into the phase space simplification:\na_j - a_j^* = i \\frac{1}{8 \\pi \\sqrt{s}} \\rho \\left( a_j - a_j^* \\right) = -2 \\operatorname{Im} a_j\nHere, `a_j` is the partial wave amplitude, `s` is the Mandelstam variable (center-of-mass energy squared), and `\\rho` represents the phase space factor.\nA key simplification involves a “magic formula” (derivation omitted but available in references) that connects the initial and final states. The initial state has an angle of zero, while the final state is described by the transition matrix `T`. For the final state, the Legendre polynomial `P_J(\\cos \\theta)` is equivalent to the Wigner `D`-function `D_{00}^J(\\cos \\theta)`.\nThis leads to the powerful relation:\nD_{00}^J(\\cos \\theta) = d^J_p(\\theta) d^J_q(\\theta)\nHere, `D_{00}^J` is the Wigner `D`-function for zero helicity states, and `d^J_p`, `d^J_q` are the small Wigner `d`-functions. The capital `G`-function is defined as:\nG_{\\lambda=00} = e^{-i \\lambda \\theta} d^J(\\theta)\nThe integration over all possible intermediate states requires expanding the cosine between the first and last states into a composition of intermediate angles. This expansion is necessary to relate the amplitude to the partial wave decomposition.\nThe final step involves dividing both sides of the equation by `a_j`, leading to:\n\\frac{1}{a_j} - \\frac{1}{a_j^*} = -2i \\operatorname{Im} \\left( \\frac{1}{a_j} \\right)\nThis reveals that the imaginary part of the partial wave amplitude is simply `i - \\ell`, where `\\ell` is the angular momentum.

It’s amazing because it tells us exactly how the inverse amplitude—the imaginary part of the inverse amplitude—looks like. Let’s plot it. Here’s `S`, and here is the imaginary part of `a_J` and the phase space function.\nThe phase space factor here is a function that starts from threshold and approaches `1/(16\\pi)` at infinity. It has a square-root behavior near threshold: `\\sqrt{s - (M_1 + M_2)^2}`. It begins with a square-root dependence but then approaches a constant, `1/(16\\pi)` or `1/(8\\pi \\lambda^{1/2}/s)`. Since `P` is a channel function, this is expected.\nNow, the key point is modeling. We know the imaginary part, but we do not know the real part. The real part of the amplitude is specific to the interaction. So far, everything applies universally—electromagnetic, strong, or gravitational interactions. Any unitary interaction must have an imaginary part related to phase space. However, the real part must be computed or modeled.\nExperimentalists extract the real part by analyzing data, such as from LABIS or harmonic measurements. The simplest model assumes the inverse amplitude equals some real function. One option for this real function is a pole, which is a common approximation.\nFor example, we can write:\n\\frac{1}{a_j} = K - i \\rho\nHere, `K` is a real function (e.g., a pole term), and `\\rho` is the phase space factor.

If we shrink the contour, it becomes an integral from zero to minus one of the function evaluated above. One probably finds the same answer, which in this case will be five.\nThis is a nice property of analytic functions, where Cauchy’s theorem plays a crucial role. It states that you can deform your contour of integration freely as long as you avoid non-analytic regions. You can compute the integral along a circular contour or shrink it into a different path. For this example, I encourage you to verify that these methods yield the same result. If they don’t, we can discuss it further—I believe it’s a straightforward calculation, but we’ll proceed for now.\nWhat remains is to evaluate the imaginary part of the expression, which is simply `\\sqrt{x} \\cdot i` (or without the `i`), leading to a simple integration on the real axis.\nThe scattering amplitude is a remarkable function. Returning to our earlier discussion, we derived the optical theorem and examined the analytic structure of this function. The claim is that the amplitude is a “real magic” function—or at least part of it.\nLet’s clarify the assumptions and physical principles here. The amplitude itself is not directly measurable in experiments; we only observe its square. Access to the amplitude is indirect, mediated by observables. However, scattering theory and probability conservation impose constraints on the amplitude, particularly on its imaginary part, and dictate where this imaginary part exists.\nThe analyticity of the amplitude is a postulate—a foundational principle of our framework. It’s stronger than an assumption; it’s the building block of our series. All theories we’ve discussed so far incorporate unitarity, which is tied to causality—a property linked to analyticity.\nThe amplitude being analytic is postulated in our theory, but it’s connected to causality: events outside each other’s light cones cannot influence one another. This relationship between causality and analyticity is discussed in various textbooks, but we take it as a given here.\nUnitarity further refines this picture. The amplitude is real analytic below the threshold, meaning it has no imaginary part in this regime. The imaginary part arises only above the threshold, as it’s associated with particle production in intermediate states. Below threshold, the amplitude is purely real.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nThe optical theorem connects the imaginary part of the amplitude to the total cross-section, reinforcing the relationship between analyticity and unitarity.\n\nThis structure—analyticity, unitarity, and causality—forms the backbone of scattering theory, ensuring consistency with physical principles while enabling predictive power."

    "text": "6 Threshold Singularities and Branch Points in Scattering Amplitudes\nBelow the threshold, the amplitude has no imaginary part—it is purely real. Consider a diagram on the x-axis representing the complex plane of energy, where `S = E^2` and `E` is the center-of-mass energy. The amplitude `A(S)` is an analytic function, but we typically deal with its values only above the threshold. However, the principles of our theory allow us to extend the domain of definition into the full complex plane using analyticity.\nThis means we can treat the amplitude as a complex function, probing it not just for real interaction energies (e.g., 5 GeV) but also for complex values. This extended function exhibits singularities, particularly branch points. The absence of an imaginary part below threshold and its sudden appearance above threshold indicates the emergence of these singularities.\nFor example, the two-particle threshold introduces a square-root singularity, as seen in the prefactor of the imaginary part of the amplitude:\n\n\\text{Im} \\, A(s) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{8\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{2p}{\\sqrt{s}} |a(s)|^2\n\nHere, `p` is the breakup momentum, given by:\n\np = \\frac{\\lambda^{1/2}}{2\\sqrt{s}}, \\quad \\lambda^{1/2}(s, m_1^2, m_2^2) = \\sqrt{[s - (m_1 + m_2)^2][s - (m_1 - m_2)^2]}\n\nThe breakup momentum `p` vanishes at the threshold, where the system has minimal energy—just the sum of the particle masses. At this point, the particles have no residual momentum, and the singularity arises from the vanishing of `p`.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe phase space factor `\\frac{2p}{\\sqrt{s}}` in the imaginary part of the amplitude is directly tied to the two-body phase space and vanishes at threshold, reflecting the kinematic constraints of particle production.\n\nThis structure is generic: every threshold introduces singularities, and their form depends on the number of particles involved. For a detailed derivation, refer to Gribov’s book, but the square-root singularity for the two-particle case is straightforward to derive from the properties of the imaginary part and phase space."

The first term gives a singularity at the threshold, while the second gives a singularity at the pseudothreshold.\nThe relation we wrote is valid only above the threshold, where the imaginary part is non-zero and appears only once you cross the threshold. This imaginary part exhibits a square-root behavior, indicating that the function itself has a square-root singularity.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe square-root singularity above the threshold suggests a branch point in the amplitude, connecting the function’s behavior in the upper and lower half-planes.\n\nThis connects to the Schwarz reflection principle. Since our function was real and analytic on a segment of the real axis, the Schwarz reflection principle applies. It relates the amplitude in the upper half-plane to the amplitude in the lower half-plane.

    "text": "8 Analytic Structure and Branch Points in Complex Functions\nThe function `F(x + i\\epsilon)` tells us that the imaginary part flips when crossing the real axis from above to below. This is a relation where `\\epsilon` is infinitesimal.\nThe term “infinitesimal” means very, very small. In this context, `i\\epsilon` is a small imaginary displacement indicating whether you are evaluating the function just above or just below the real axis.\nThis behavior arises due to phase space considerations. If there were no phase space configuration summations, the imaginary part could be directly related to the amplitude itself, and there might not even be branch points. However, summing over phase space configurations introduces a square-root branch point.\nThis branch point indicates that the amplitude has a singularity starting at the threshold and extending in the positive direction.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe amplitude’s branch point structure is tied to the analytic continuation of the function across the real axis, where the function’s value changes depending on the direction of approach.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider a simple real analytic function with a branch cut, such as the square root function. The square root of `x` has a branch cut on the left side of the complex plane.\nTo determine where the branch cut lies, evaluate the function just above and below the real axis:\n\nFor `x = -1 + i\\epsilon`, `\\sqrt{-1 + i\\epsilon} = i`\n\nFor `x = -1 - i\\epsilon`, `\\sqrt{-1 - i\\epsilon} = -i`\n\nThis shows that the function changes sign when crossing the branch cut, confirming its non-analytic nature.\nA branch point splits the complex plane into distinct Riemann sheets, where the function takes different values on each sheet. The branch cut is the curve connecting the branch point to infinity, separating these sheets.\nThe square-root singularity is a common feature in scattering amplitudes, particularly near kinematic thresholds. This structure is mathematically unavoidable due to the phase space constraints and leads to the analytic properties observed in physical amplitudes.\nThe Schwarz reflection principle further connects the behavior of the amplitude in the upper and lower half-planes. If `F(z)` is analytic in the upper half-plane and real on the real axis, then:\n\nF(z^*) = F^*(z)\n\nThis allows for the analytic continuation of the amplitude into the full complex plane, revealing the underlying singularity structure."

Essentially, you need to analytically continue these functions. If you observe the pattern, you can always make the function analytic, but it requires extending the domain of analyticity.\nReturning to the example, consider the function `-X`. Its analytic structure can be evaluated in the complex plane, revealing full analyticity except for a branch cut extending to the right. Evaluating this function at `-1` gives:\n\nF(-1) = 1 - (-1) = 2\n\nThis is an example of a real analytic function. Another example is the amplitude:\n\nA(s) = \\sqrt{-s + m_1 m_2}\n\nThis function has similar properties.\nIn the `x`-plane, the first function has a branch cut on the right, while the second function has a shifted cut. When these cuts overlap, there is no discontinuity, and the function remains analytic in that region. The correct structure consists of cuts connecting two points, which can be subtle to identify at first glance.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe absence of a jump in the function where cuts overlap indicates analyticity in that region, despite the presence of branch cuts elsewhere.\n\nThe square-root function serves as a simple illustration of branch cuts. For example:\n\n`\\sqrt{-1 + i\\epsilon} = i`\n\n`\\sqrt{-1 - i\\epsilon} = -i`\n\nThis sign change across the branch cut confirms the non-analytic behavior.\nThe Schwarz reflection principle connects the function’s behavior in the upper and lower half-planes:\n\nF(z^*) = F^*(z)\n\nThis allows for analytic continuation and reveals the underlying singularity structure.

The first time I saw this in a mathematical context, I was shocked because the branch points are the same — there are two points `X` and `X` where the function is non-analytic.\nThe location of the cut is determined by where the imaginary part of the expression under the square root has an argument of `\\pi` or `-\\pi`. For the regular square root function, the cut appears where the argument is either `1` or `-1`.\nTo understand where Mathematica, C, or Python libraries would draw a cut, you need to analyze where the expression under the square root has an argument touching `\\pi` or `-\\pi`. The cut lies between the points and also extends along a line to infinity.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe first cut goes to infinity, and the second cut also goes to infinity, but this behavior differs from other cases.\n\nIf you split the product into two square roots, the argument changes, and you remove these two cuts. This is not meant to confuse but to warn that one must be careful with how expressions are written. The exact way you split the square root affects the function’s behavior — they may appear the same on the real axis but differ in the complex plane."

To prove they are not equal, we can evaluate the function here minus one. The analytic structure of this function consists of one cut and then a second cut, with two branch points connected by the cut. To transform from this configuration to another, we can take this cut, rotate it over here, take the other cut, rotate it over there, and cancel the two cuts. This shows that the function in the original configuration has a different value minus one.\nEvaluating the top expression gives:\n\n\\sqrt{-2 + 2 - 1 - 2 + 2}\n\nwhile evaluating the second expression gives:\n\n\\sqrt{2i}\n\nThe product of these results is `-\\sqrt{2}`. Resonances are poles of the scattering amplitude. When you hear about resonances, think of the intensity flow. The function in the complex plane is like the structure of a house, and the routers in the house are the resonances. The farther you are from the router, the weaker the signal you receive. If you sit at a point with good Internet, you are likely close to a router.\nThis is analogous to our position in the house where people experience different Internet strengths. The routers represent the resonances. Here, the Y-axis represents the complex `S` plane, with real `S` on the axis and minus imaginary `S` indicated here. This is the same as the complex frame. A square represents the strength of your Internet when you sit on the couch. The middle of the square is the closest distance to the router (resonance), so the signal strength is highest. As you move away, the Internet weakens.\nNow, let’s make the house more complex by adding several floors. The cuts represent the map of the room. The couch where people sit is on the real axis, but the house has multiple floors with different electronics. If there is a router in another room, you can still experience its influence from your position.\nSheet one represents floor one, and sheet two represents floor two. The gate is like stairs connecting the floors. If a router is placed here, the signal strength is strong here and here, but weakens around the corner. The distance increases, and the signal must travel around the wall. The gate to the other floor allows access only from one side.\nThe picture of floors and routers is helpful but can be overwhelming. The routers are the resonances, and you can see them on each floor if they are above the threshold. When you hear about the complex plane and poles, think of the intensity flow in the house."

On this multi-level surface, routers are placed, influencing the intensity observed on the relaxers.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe difference between a larger room and multiple floors is negligible. Both are infinitely large, but the floors are smoothly connected, requiring multiple maps or sheets for representation—similar to shopping mall floor plans.\n\nFor the square root function `\\sqrt{x}`, the branch cut is conventionally placed to the right, but practically, nothing prevents placing it to the left. Consider evaluating the function at `-1`:\n\n\\sqrt{-1} = i\n\nFor `-1 + \\epsilon` (where `\\epsilon` is infinitesimal), the result remains `i`. Rotating the branch cut simply reconfigures the “rooms” (sheets) without altering the function’s behavior. The cut is merely a way to separate floors, not a physical barrier—there are no walls blocking signal strength.\n\n[!TIP]\nFor practical convenience, it is natural to place the branch cut in the most accessible location, such as the negative real axis.\n\nThe analytic structure of the function involves branch points connected by cuts.

    "text": "5 Scattering Length and Relativistic Formulation\nThe scattering length is measured in Fermi (fm), but in relativistic formulations, it appears dimensionless. In quantum mechanics, the scattering length is defined through the expansion of the amplitude in terms of the breakup momentum `K`, which has units of GeV. Therefore, `1/a` has units of GeV, and `a` itself is in Fermi.\nThe non-relativistic amplitude is given by:\n\nf_{NR} = \\frac{1}{a - i\\,k}\n\nIn the relativistic formulation, the amplitude becomes:\n\nf_{R} = \\frac{1}{\\tilde a^{-1} - i\\,\\frac{2k}{\\sqrt{s}}}\n\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe imaginary part of the relativistic amplitude is related to the dimensionless phase space. The first expansion term resembles the scattering length but is itself dimensionless.\n\nTo relate the two formulations, we match them at the threshold. At threshold (`k \\to 0`), the non-relativistic amplitude reduces to `f_{NR} = a`, while the relativistic amplitude becomes `f_{R} = \\tilde a`. However, they are not directly equal—there is a numerical constant relating them.\nThe key is to equate the numerators or denominators up to a numerical factor. The difference arises from the relativistic phase space factor:\n\n\\frac{2k}{\\sqrt{s}} = -i\\,k \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{8\\pi^2 s}\\right)\n\nAt threshold, `\\sqrt{s}` is the sum of the masses involved. For example, if the scattering length `a` is 3 Fermi, we can determine `\\tilde a` by matching the amplitudes at threshold.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nThe conversion between `a` and `\\tilde a` involves the threshold energy and masses. Specifically, `\\tilde a = a / (8\\pi^2 s_{\\text{threshold}})`, where `s_{\\text{threshold}}` is the squared invariant mass at threshold.\n\nThis exercise demonstrates how relativistic effects modify the low-energy expansion of scattering amplitudes. The dimensionless `\\tilde a` in the relativistic case must be rescaled by the threshold kinematics to recover the conventional scattering length `a` in Fermi.\n\nThe discussion also touches on meson states, such as the `P_1(1400)`, which was initially misidentified in older data but later corrected to appear at 1600 MeV in more precise analyses. This highlights the importance of accurate measurements in determining resonance properties.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe `\\pi_1` meson has quantum numbers `1^- +`, which are forbidden in the standard quark model, suggesting it is a hybrid meson with gluonic excitations. Similarly, the `P_1(1400)` exhibits a hybrid nature due to gluonic string interactions rather than a simple quark-antiquark configuration.\n\nThe parity and charge conjugation quantum numbers play a crucial role in identifying such exotic states. For instance, the `\\pi` meson has `0^- +`, while the `B_1` meson has `1^+ -`. Decays involving these states may exhibit isospin violation, particularly when charge conjugation conservation is enforced.\nIn higher partial waves (D-wave, F-wave), the allowed orbital angular momentum states further constrain the possible quantum numbers and decay patterns of mesons. This underscores the complexity of meson spectroscopy and the need for careful theoretical and experimental scrutiny."

    "text": "20 Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in QCD\nThe left-handed and right-handed states do not talk to each other, so there is an extra phase here and another extra phase there. These phases cancel each other, and the symmetry is only broken when mass terms are introduced. This breaks the scale symmetry. The mass term mixes the two states, so the phase appears in one combination of the `\\alpha` parameters and disappears in the other.\nThe mass term explicitly breaks chiral symmetry, but there is another effect: chiral symmetry is also spontaneously broken. Even if you start with no mass term in QCD, the quarks generate a non-zero expectation value through their interactions. This means the quarks appear massive even without an explicit mass term in the Lagrangian.\nThe QCD vacuum has a non-zero expectation value, expressed as:\n\n\\langle 0 |\\, \\bar{\\Psi}_L \\Psi_R \\,| 0 \\rangle \\ne 0 \\quad \\text{for } m_q = 0.\n\nThis is a spectacular result — the entire symmetry is broken. To visualize this, imagine a field space where the vacuum state is not at zero but at a shifted location. The potential of the theory has a shape similar to the Higgs potential, resembling a Mexican hat.\nWhen quantum fluctuations are integrated out, the effective potential takes this form, and the vacuum settles at a non-zero expectation value. This is the essence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The theory could have a vacuum with exact chiral symmetry (located at zero), but energetically, it is favorable for the vacuum to have a non-zero expectation value.\nThis mechanism appears in many areas of physics: superconductivity (where electron pairs form Cooper pairs), the Higgs mechanism, and other examples. The common feature is an exact symmetry at the origin of the field space, but the physical vacuum is displaced due to interactions.\nThe spontaneous breaking is driven by the shape of the potential. The interaction terms, when integrated over quantum fluctuations, produce a potential that favors a non-zero vacuum expectation value. This is the origin of the mass gap in QCD, even in the absence of explicit mass terms.\nThe current symmetry corresponds to independent transformations of the left- and right-handed components. For a global symmetry, there are eight parameters for the left-handed rotation and eight for the right-handed rotation, totaling 16 real parameters. The Lagrangian remains invariant under these transformations if the mass term is zero, since left- and right-handed states decouple.\nThe flavor space (SU(3)) is described by a three-component vector, and `\\alpha` is a `3 \\times 3` matrix independent of coordinates.

When you write this, the point you choose is the corrected state. It is the expectation value for the correlation. The possibility of `Q` on both sides is not necessarily zero — it depends on the context.\nThe axis represents the expectation value of the field. Strictly speaking, in quantum field theory, the potential itself is undefined. What is defined is the expectation value of the field. You can plot the potential as a function of this expectation value.

This `S` is a convenient variable to describe the scattering amplitude, where the partial wave amplitude `f` is a function of this single variable.\nEquivalently, one can consider the breakup momentum variable `K`, which represents the momentum carried by each particle. Here, `S` is the squared energy of the system in the center-of-mass frame, while `K` is the momentum of each particle in the same frame. The relationship between `S` and `K` is given by the channeling function, and the analytic structure of the amplitude is simpler in terms of `K` near the threshold.\nInstead of working in the `S`-plane, where the amplitude is analytic except for a few singularities, we now examine the `K`-plane and relate the structures between the two planes. Specifically, we map the following points from the `S`-plane to the `K`-plane:\n\nPoints 1 and 2: Resonances located on the second Riemann sheet with respect to the threshold in `S`.\n\nPoint 3: A pole on the real axis in the first Riemann sheet, corresponding to a bound state.\n\nPoint 4: A virtual state, residing on the unphysical sheet below the threshold.\n\nThe goal is to understand how these singularities and structures translate when mapped from the `S`-plane to the `K`-plane.\nS = 4(K^2 + m^2)\nwhere `m` is the mass of the particle.

It is easier to start by mapping the real axis first and then determine the positions of other features relative to it.\nThe real axis above the threshold corresponds to a physical region, and this physical region is preserved when mapped to the `K`-plane. The point where `S = 0` corresponds to the threshold in the `K`-plane. Below the threshold, when `S` is smaller than the threshold value, the square root of `S` becomes imaginary, meaning `K` is also imaginary.\nThe other square root term (from the breakup momentum function) does not change sign when crossing the threshold. This term remains negative, so it does not introduce any additional complications near the threshold. However, there is a branch point somewhere between zero and the threshold on the real axis in the `K`-plane.\nThe region close to zero in the `K`-plane is more complicated due to this branch point, but the focus here is on the behavior near the threshold. The key observation is that the physical region in the `S`-plane maps directly to the physical region in the `K`-plane, while non-physical regions (below threshold) map to imaginary values in the `K`-plane.\nThe mapping simplifies the analysis of scattering amplitudes, particularly near thresholds, by transforming the `S`-plane structure into a more tractable form in the `K`-plane.

However, one of the important phenomena in QCD is confinement. People began understanding the dynamics of QCD by studying protons, neutrons, and nuclear interactions, which exhibit features of confinement.\nFor comparison, consider electron-proton scattering or electron-electron scattering, where the electromagnetic coupling constant is small:\n\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi} = \\frac{1}{137}\nThis small coupling allows perturbative expansions using Feynman diagrams in QED. However, in QCD, the theory is not in a perturbative regime due to confinement.\nThe degrees of freedom—quarks and gluons—are confined to small scales, forming composite fields such as mesons. This non-perturbative behavior distinguishes QCD from QED, where perturbation theory is applicable.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe confinement phenomenon means that quarks and gluons cannot be isolated as free particles; they only exist within bound states like hadrons.\n\nThe transition from perturbative to non-perturbative dynamics in QCD is a key aspect of its study, as it governs the formation of hadronic matter."

This parameter appears in the Lagrangian and action, allowing an expansion in powers of `\\hbar`.\nThe first term in this expansion gives the average value of the fields, which we identify as the classical field. For example, the field `\\sigma` can be obtained by performing an `\\hbar`-expansion of the Lagrangian. The leading term yields not the fluctuating quantum field but the classical average value of `\\sigma` in space.\nAt this level, `\\sigma` is no longer a function of spacetime coordinates `x` (i.e., it does not fluctuate) but is instead a fixed value.

In the chiral limit, where quark masses are set to zero, pions and kaons become massless (as they are Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking), but the proton remains massive. This is because the proton’s mass arises from the dynamics of quark-gluon interactions, not from the quark masses themselves.\nThe proton is composed of three quarks, but unlike pions, it is not a Goldstone boson. Pions are fluctuations of the quark condensate (the `\\sigma` field), while protons are excitations of this condensate with additional energy stored in their structure. The mass of the proton is thus a manifestation of the strong interaction energy within QCD.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nThe mass of hadrons (except Goldstone bosons like pions) is determined by the curvature of the QCD potential. Pions move along flat directions of the potential (no curvature, hence massless), while protons and other hadrons correspond to excitations with non-zero curvature, giving them mass.\n\nThe quark-gluon interactions in mesons also exist, but the key difference lies in the nature of their excitations. The quark condensate forms a background, and pions are small fluctuations on this background, whereas protons are more complex excitations with additional energy contributions.\nTo understand this mathematically, one can examine how the `\\sigma` field acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation value and how pions emerge as fluctuations along flat directions of the potential. The mass of particles corresponds to the curvature of the potential, and since pions move along directions with no curvature, they remain massless.

This is especially true for the light quarks (`u` and `d`), whose masses are much smaller than the QCD scale of 1 GeV. Introducing small quark masses does not drastically alter the physics.\nWhen quark masses are introduced, they effectively add a linear term to the potential, slightly skewing it. The overall picture remains almost the same, but the minimum on one side becomes more pronounced. In the pion direction, there is now a curvature, making pions slightly massive. The theory, however, remains fundamentally unchanged.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe Mexican hat potential develops a curvature in the pion direction due to quark masses, giving pions a small mass while preserving the structure of QCD.\n\nOne important quantity often discussed is the ratio of the proton mass to the pion mass, which is primarily determined by QCD interactions and does not change significantly even if quark masses are increased. Computations of properties in lattice QCD are highly dependent on the quark masses used. Interestingly, calculations appear easier when pions are slightly heavier, achieved by introducing larger quark masses. Despite this, the essential properties of the theory—such as those of mesons—do not change much.\nWhile details like particle masses and widths do change, the broader characteristics remain stable. This means that even with unphysical pion masses in simulations, we can still extract meaningful insights.

The more steps you take in the lattice, the better the approximation. Increasing the volume of the box significantly would make computations more intensive, but the box is never truly empty. Even if no explicit particles are placed inside, the vacuum itself contains fluctuating quantum fields. These fields interact, and the box is filled with correlated fields, visualized as bubbles appearing and disappearing in the vacuum.\nAdjusting discretization by varying grid spacing is important.

The inequality shows that the electron channel is suppressed compared to the muon channel due to the smaller mass of the electron.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nChirality is directly related to spin orientation in the high-mass limit, which is why we can clearly observe chiral properties in the decay products.\n\nThe weak interaction vertex ( `V-A` ) produces particles in their chiral configurations. For example, the `W` boson decay produces a left-handed electron and a left-handed neutrino. Since the neutrino is massless, it is purely left-handed, while the electron has both left and right components, with the right component suppressed by `m_e / E`.\nIn the center-of-momentum frame, the spins of the decay products must sum to the spin of the pion ( `J = 0` ). For the electron and neutrino, their spins are `1/2`, and they must be back-to-back to conserve angular momentum. However, flipping the spin of the right-handed electron is allowed but suppressed by `m_e / E`, whereas the neutrino cannot be flipped due to its zero mass.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe suppression factor differs for electrons and muons because `m_e \\ll m_\\mu`. For the pion decay into muons, the muon is nearly non-relativistic, so the chirality suppression is less pronounced.\n\nThe matrix elements for `\\pi^+ \\to e^+ \\nu_e` and `\\pi^+ \\to \\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu` are thus differently suppressed, with the electron channel being heavily suppressed due to its small mass. This explains why the pion predominantly decays into muons rather than electrons."

The correct answer is that the ratio is significantly less than one, which is why pions decay predominantly to muons rather than electrons.\nPhase space represents the number of possible configurations in the decay. For two-body decays, it is determined by angular configurations, but there is also an energy-dependent factor. The larger the energy release, the larger the phase space.\nFor the muon decay channel, the initial energy is given by the pion mass, and the final state includes particles with their own masses. The energy release is the difference between these masses. In the electron channel, the mass difference is small, so the energy release is tiny. In contrast, for the muon channel, most of the energy goes into kinetic energy because the neutrino is nearly massless.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe phase space is larger when more energy is released, favoring the muon channel despite the phase space ratio formula suggesting otherwise.\n\nThe suppression of the electron channel is due to the small mass difference, which limits the available phase space compared to the muon channel. This explains why pions decay predominantly to muons.\n\n$$ ## Magnetic Moment of the Muon and Quantum Corrections\nBecause the pion is massless and the electron is almost massless, the phase space is much larger. For the second case, however, this does not compensate the suppression. Let’s consider the phase space of the electron channel. There is an angle integral which I’m going to implement now, and the neutrino phase space is something like that. The breakup momentum is something I need to evaluate, and I will double-check the calculation.\nThe challenge function is the mass of the pion, and another channel function is zero. The chaining function is `xyz`, so it would be `x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2 \\Delta E`. Once I drop the terms `x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2x^2 - 2yz - 2zx`, and then if `b = 0`, this term is dropped. The remaining expression is just the difference, which is a full square. I then substitute `(s - m_e^2) / (s - m_\\mu^2)`. This full square is dropped because of the `1/2` factor, and this is the answer.\nThis node does not compensate the suppression, so the dominant decay of the pion is the muon channel. It’s important to realize the steps we’ve taken because this is a nice piece of physics. It explains how parity violation was discovered—by observing that the muon is the predominant decay product. For this vertex to be `V - A` weak interaction, you need this term to violate parity.\nAnother interesting fact is that in this decay, the muon is produced polarized. The pion doesn’t carry spin, and the neutrino is not detected—it just flies away. The muon, however, is produced polarized. In 1967, an experiment confirmed this. What’s remarkable about the muon is that it is self-analyzing. Its decay to an electron, neutrino, and antineutrino has an angular distribution of electrons that indicates the muon’s polarization.\nThis is a very elegant setup. You can analyze the vertex here, which has a `V - A` current that violates parity. The axial term `\\gamma_5` would violate parity, and you can check this easily. The second decay, the muon decay, produces a charged track. The angular distribution of this track in the muon’s rest frame tells you whether the muon is polarized.\nIf the muon is not polarized, the electron directions are equally probable in the helicity frame. But if it is polarized, the forward direction is preferred—aligned with the spin. The muon carries its spin as it flies, and in its rest frame, you only have spin information. This is called the KTG frame. In this frame, the electron preferentially moves in a certain direction, though it can go anywhere—just with different probabilities.\nIntegrating over the electron energies reveals that this is the preferred configuration, even for a linearly polarized muon beam. Shortly after, the same technique was used to measure something more fundamental: the magnetic moment of the muon.\nWe discussed this in the second lecture when we calculated the quark content of the proton’s magnetic moment. Let me remind you what it is. The magnetic moment of a particle describes its interaction with a magnetic field. For a point-like fermion, it is given by the Bohr magneton and the gyromagnetic factor:\n\n\\vec{\\mu} = \\frac{e}{2m} g \\vec{S}, \\quad g = 2 \\ \\text{(Dirac, pointlike)}\n\nThis is a fundamental quantity, and `g = 2` for a fermion. However, for the proton, we found `g \\approx 2.8`. How can this be if the proton is a fermion? This discrepancy indicates that the proton is not pointlike—it is made of quarks.\nIn the quark model, we computed the correct value by considering the charges and masses of the constituent quarks. For the proton, the charge `e` is `+1`, but for quarks, it is fractional. The masses are taken as constituent quark masses, around 0.3 GeV for up and down quarks.\nFor the muon, however, we do not doubt that it is an elementary particle with no internal structure. We expect `g = 2`, but this is only true at first order. There are corrections from virtual processes that make `g` not exactly 2. The quantity `a = (g - 2)/2` is used to describe these corrections.\nThe muon’s `g - 2` is one of the most precisely known numbers in physics. It is a key test of quantum field theory and may hint at new physics if discrepancies with theory are found. $$"

Since pions produce polarized muons, the initial spin configuration is already aligned for measurement.\nWhen the muon enters the magnetic field, its spin begins precessing as it moves along the circular path. The spin orientation is measured by detecting the electrons from muon decay. The muon bunch contains millions of particles, and as they decay, the emitted electrons are observed.\nThe setup includes lead glass calorimeters placed inside the ring. Lead glass is used because its high atomic number (`Z`) ensures particles deposit all their energy within the material. The glass remains transparent to light, allowing photosensors at the ends to collect the energy deposited by incoming particles.\nThese calorimeters measure the electron flux. If the muon spin points outward, fewer electrons are detected compared to when it points inward.\n\n$$ ## Hadronic Contributions to Anomalous Magnetic Moment\nThe spin precession frequency `\\omega_s` is measured in experiments like the muon `g-2` experiment. If the spin points outwards, there is a loss of detected electrons, while if it points inwards, more electrons are observed. This creates fluctuations in the energy deposit along the circular path.\nIn the `g-2` measurement setup, the digital flow shows time on the x-axis and a signal related to energy deposit. The frequency of rotation remains constant because it is determined by the charge of the electron. Over time, muons in the batch decay, causing the overall energy deposit to decrease exponentially. However, this decay is modulated by spin rotation fluctuations.\nThe analysis is blinded, meaning the true frequency is hidden until the final results are revealed. For instance, in a recent press release, the analysts wrote down the real frequency on a piece of paper in an envelope beforehand. During the press conference, the envelope was opened, and the true frequency was entered to unblind the results.\nThe experiment measures `\\omega_s`, but the key observable is the difference between `\\omega_s` and the cyclotron frequency `\\omega_c`. If these frequencies were identical, the spin configuration would propagate uniformly, and no fluctuations would be observed. The experiment’s sensitivity comes from this difference.\nMuons are naturally polarized when produced in pion decays due to the weak interaction vertex, which enforces a specific chirality. This polarization is crucial for the experiment. The next-generation experiment is currently underway, with the primary challenge being the homogeneity of the magnetic field. Even slight inhomogeneities introduce uncertainties because the integral of the magnetic field experienced by the muon varies.\nThe precision of the experiment is quantified in parts per billion (ppb). The current experimental uncertainty is 63 ppb, while the theoretical prediction is around 100 ppb.\nThe hadronic contributions to the muon’s anomalous magnetic moment are significant. Beyond QED corrections, there are electroweak and hadronic effects. Two prominent hadronic contributions are:\n1. Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP): A photon produces hadrons, which then recombine into a photon. This is represented by the diagram where a photon splits into hadrons and reforms.\n2. Hadronic Light-by-Light (HLbL) Scattering: This involves photons interacting via intermediate hadrons. The process can be visualized as light entering and exiting a hadronic blob, with intermediate hadron states like `\\pi^0` or `\\eta` mesons, which decay into two photons.\nThe quantum numbers (`J^{PC}`) of the intermediate hadrons must match those of the photon for the process to occur.\n$$"

Consider a function `f(s)` that is real analytic in the domain below a cut, where the cut starts at a threshold `s_{\\text{th}}`. The dispersion relation is given by:\n\nf(s) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{s_{\\text{th}}}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Im} f(s' + i0)}{s' - s} \\, ds'\n\nNow, let’s apply a contour integration trick. Suppose we have a function `G(s)` that is analytic everywhere except along a cut. We can write:\n\nG(s) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{G(s_1)}{s_1 - s} \\, ds_1\n\nHere, `C` is a contour enclosing the singularity at `s`. By deforming the contour, we encounter two contributions: one from a large circle (which vanishes if `G(s)` decays sufficiently at infinity) and another from the cut along the real axis.\nThe key property we use is the behavior of `G(s)` near the cut. For `s` just above the cut (`s + i0`) and just below (`s - i0`), the function satisfies:\n\nG(s + i0) = G^*(s - i0)\n\nThis means the real parts are equal, while the imaginary parts have opposite signs.\n\n[!NOTE]\nA simple example is `G(x) = \\sqrt{1 - x}`, which has a cut starting at `x = 1`.

Below the cut (for `x = -8`):\n\nG(-8) = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n\nThis function is real analytic below the cut.\nUsing these properties, we can rewrite the contour integral as:\n\nG(s) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{s_{\\text{th}}}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Im} G(s' + i0)}{s' - s} \\, ds'\n\nThe minus sign arises because the integral along one side of the cut cancels the integral along the other side, but with opposite directions.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nIf `G(s)` drops fast enough as `|s| \\to \\infty`, the contribution from the large circle vanishes, leaving only the integral over the cut.\n\nThis is the essence of the dispersion relation, which allows us to reconstruct the full function from its imaginary part along the cut.\n\n[!TIP]\nThe dispersion relation is particularly useful in physics for recovering scattering amplitudes or other analytic functions from their discontinuities across cuts, which are often related to physical processes like particle production thresholds.\n\nThe final formula we derived is:\n\nG(s) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{s_{\\text{th}}}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Im} G(s' + i0)}{s' - s} \\, ds'\n\nThis is a powerful tool for analyzing functions with known analytic properties and discontinuities."

    "text": "11 Understanding Subtraction in Dispersion Relations\nThis function allows us to recover the full function from its imaginary part. It tells us what the function is equal to here, and using this relation, we can determine it anywhere in the complex plane.\nThis is an advanced subject in dispersion relations, but it’s part of the coursework. It’s a little exercise that helps you understand better how dispersion works. The key concept here is subtraction.\nWhen people say they perform this dispersion relation with one subtraction, it means two poles are introduced. The integral involves the variable `s'`, and the term `s - a` appears outside the integral. This term vanishes when `s = a`, so to maintain the correct relation, we include `g(a)` explicitly.\nThis is called a one-subtracted dispersion relation. The simplest subtraction occurs at `a = 0`, giving:\n\ng(s) = g(0) + \\frac{s}{\\pi} \\int_{s_{\\text{th}}}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Im}g(s')}{s'(s'-s)} \\, ds'\n\nHere, the extra `s` in the denominator comes from the subtraction. This is necessary when the function does not decrease fast enough at infinity. In such cases, you must use a one-subtracted or even a twice-subtracted relation.\nFor a twice-subtracted dispersion relation, the term `(s - a)` is raised to the second power, modifying the integral further.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nSubtractions are essential when the function’s high-energy behavior does not satisfy the conditions for an unsubtracted dispersion relation. They allow us to still reconstruct the function using its imaginary part, even when it decays too slowly.\n\nThis method is widely used in physics, particularly in scattering amplitude analysis, where discontinuities across cuts correspond to physical thresholds.\n\n$$ ## R Ratio and Resonances in Experimental Measurements\nThe R ratio is defined as:\n\nR(s) = \\frac{\\sigma(e^{+}e^{-}\\!\\to\\!\\text{hadrons})}{\\sigma_{0}(e^{+}e^{-}\\!\\to\\!\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-})}\n\nThe function is real up to the threshold, and this implies a specific relation. When the function is real in the vicinity and we approach the threshold, the imaginary part appears with opposite signs on either side of the cut. This is how analyticity introduces the imaginary part consistently from both sides of the cut.\nFor example, consider the function `X` where:\n\nX - X = \\int \\frac{X}{5}\n\nThe imaginary part of `\\sqrt{X(1 - X)}` can be evaluated explicitly, and we must also include the value at zero, which is one. This may seem surprising, but it works mathematically because we started with an analytic function.\nThe imaginary part of the square root is hyperscaling, so we can express it as a real mathematical relation. Now, we relate the imaginary part of this block to the cross section through the optical theorem. The cross section is the observable, and it corresponds to the imaginary part.\nThe R ratio’s denominator is the theoretical cross section for `e^{+}e^{-}\\!\\to\\!\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}`, which is not directly measured in experiments but is very close to what we observe. The exercise sheet highlights the small differences between theory and experiment.\nThe R ratio reveals all the resonances that can appear, such as the `\\rho`, `\\phi`, and `\\Upsilon`. These resonances sit on a background of hadronic contributions, which include quark production and subsequent hadronization into multiple pions or other particles.\n\n[!IMPORTANT]\nThe R ratio is a key observable because it captures both resonant and non-resonant (background) contributions, providing a comprehensive view of the hadronic cross section in electron-positron collisions.\n\nThe current status of the problem involves evaluating these contributions, including the challenges of modeling the hadronization process and its impact on the measured cross section. $$"

The neutrino is produced as a particle (not an antineutrino) because the electron comes with its antiparticle.\nThe weak interaction vertex involves a `V - A` structure, represented by `\\gamma^\\mu (1 - \\gamma^5)`. This projects the quark current into left-handed (LH) and right-handed (RH) components. For example, a term like `\\bar{u} \\gamma^\\mu (1 - \\gamma^5) u` ensures the quark is left-handed and the antiquark is right-handed.\nIn pion decay, the `W` boson vertex produces the final-state particles in their chiral configurations:\n- The positron (`e^+`) is right-handed.\n- The electron (`e^-`) would be left-handed.\n- The neutrino (`\\nu_e`) is purely left-handed because it is massless.\nFor a right-handed particle, the spin component aligned with momentum is dominant. For a left-handed particle, the opposite is true. In the center-of-momentum frame, the spins of the produced particles (e.g., `e^+` and `\\nu_e`) are both `1/2`, leading to a back-to-back configuration. The total spin sum must match the pion’s spin (`0`), so certain spin configurations are forbidden or suppressed.\nThe neutrino, being massless, has no right-handed component. However, the electron can have a suppressed right-handed component proportional to `m_e / E`. This suppression is stronger for the electron than for the muon due to their mass difference:\n\n\\frac{m_e}{E} \\ll \\frac{m_\\mu}{E} \\implies \\frac{|\\mathcal{M}_e|^2}{|\\mathcal{M}_\\mu|^2} \\ll 1\n\nFor the pion decay `\\pi^+ \\to \\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu`, the muon is nearly non-relativistic because the pion mass is only slightly larger than the muon mass.

The correct answer is that the ratio is significantly less than one. This explains why the pion decays predominantly to a muon and neutrino rather than an electron and neutrino.\nThe phase space represents the number of kinematic configurations available in the decay. For two-body decays, it reduces to angular configurations, which are the same for both cases. But there is also an energy-dependent factor, which determines how much energy is released in the decay.\nThe energy release is larger when the mass difference between the initial and final states is greater. For the pion decay:\n- The initial energy is given by the pion mass.\n- The final-state particles (e.g., `\\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu` or `e^+ \\nu_e`) carry their own masses.\nIn the case of `\\pi^+ \\to e^+ \\nu_e`, the energy release is tiny because the electron mass is negligible, and most of the energy goes into kinetic energy.

Consider a function `f(s)` that is real analytic in the domain below a cut, with the cut starting at a threshold `s_{\\text{th}}`. We can write:\n\nf(s) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{s_{\\text{th}}}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Im}f(s' + i0)}{s' - s} \\, ds'\n\nNow, suppose we have a function `G(s)` that is real analytic below the cut. We can represent it using contour integration:\n\nG(s) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{G(s_1)}{s_1 - s} \\, ds_1\n\nHere, `C` is a contour enclosing the point `s`. By deforming the contour, we encounter singularities—primarily the pole at `s_1 = s`—and contributions from the cut. The integral splits into two parts: one from a large circular contour and another from the cut along the real axis.\nThe key property we use is the behavior of `G(s)` near the cut. For `s` just above the cut (`s + i0`) and below (`s - i0`), the function satisfies:\n\nG(s + i0) = G^*(s - i0)\n\nThis means the real parts are equal, and the imaginary parts differ by a sign. To illustrate, take the example of `G(x) = \\sqrt{1 - x}`, which has a cut starting at `x = 1`. For `x &lt; 1`, the function is real and analytic. For `x &gt; 1`, we evaluate:\n\nG(x + i0) = \\sqrt{-(x - 1) - i0} = i \\sqrt{x - 1}\n \nG(x - i0) = -i \\sqrt{x - 1}\n\nThis confirms the relation `G(s + i0) = G^*(s - i0)`.\nUsing this, we can rewrite the contour integral. The contribution from the cut reduces to an integral over the discontinuity of `G(s)` across the cut:\n\nG(s) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\left( \\int_{\\text{cut}} \\frac{G(s_1 + i0) - G(s_1 - i0)}{s_1 - s} \\, ds_1 + \\text{circle contribution} \\right)\n\nThe discontinuity is `2i \\operatorname{Im} G(s_1 + i0)`, so:\n\nG(s) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{s_{\\text{th}}}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Im} G(s_1 + i0)}{s_1 - s} \\, ds_1 + \\text{circle term}\n\nIf `G(s)` decays sufficiently fast as `|s| \\to \\infty`, the circle contribution vanishes, leaving only the dispersion integral. This is the dispersion relation, which allows us to reconstruct the full function from its imaginary part.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe dispersion relation relies on real analyticity and the behavior of the function near its branch cut. It is a powerful tool for recovering a function from its discontinuity."

It’s a little exercise that helps you understand better how dispersion works. The key concept here is subtraction.\nWhen people say they use the dispersion relation with one subtraction, it’s not just one subtraction—two poles are introduced. The integral involves `s'` (the integration variable), and `s - a` appears outside the integral. This term vanishes when `s = a`, so to maintain the correct relation, we include `g(a)` here. This is called the one-subtracted dispersion relation.\nThe simplest subtraction occurs at `a = 0`.

This property implies specific relations for the function’s behavior.\nA key observation is that when a function is real in a certain region, the imaginary part must appear consistently across a branch cut. Specifically, if the function is real on one side of the cut, the imaginary part will emerge with opposite signs on either side of the cut. This is a consequence of analyticity — the imaginary part cannot appear arbitrarily but must follow this symmetry.\nFor example, consider a function that is real along the real axis. As we approach the branch cut, the imaginary part will manifest with a positive sign on one side and a negative sign on the other.

While they are small, their uncertainty remains too large to reduce further.\n\n\\text{Key issue: Uncertainty in hydronic contributions prevents further reduction.}"

Obstacle course this Thursday — if the weather does not improve, we will cancel.\n2. Project meeting on Friday at 2:00 — everyone is invited, even those not interested in projects. There will be sweets from Switzerland.\nThe meeting location is at Line by Line Park.\nRegarding calculations, Light by Light has 64 terms, which introduces complexity.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe uncertainty in Light by Light contributions is smaller compared to other terms, but the calculation remains challenging due to the number of terms involved."

    "text": "44 Representation Theory and Young Tableaus\nThe dependence on `Q^2` is a tricky part. I was looking for a book explaining the representation theory of `SU(N)`. I read in a textbook how you get representations from Young tableaus using representations of `S_n` (the symmetric group). It’s very exciting, but it’s hard to find a source for that.\n\n[!NOTE]\nYoung tableaus provide a combinatorial way to construct irreducible representations of `SU(N)` and `S_n`. The connection between the two is a key result in representation theory.\n\nI recall that `Z` was mentioned as a possible reference, but I’m not sure what book that refers to."
