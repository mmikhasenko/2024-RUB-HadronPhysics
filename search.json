Essentially, I like thinking of the evolution of the universe on a timescale. Here is the origin of the universe where everything started. There was a Big Bang first, and then several epochs followed. It started with the Planck epoch, then there was the electroweak epoch, quarks, and others. What has been happening during this is part of the physics that we also go through in the courses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHiggs Mechanism and Symmetry Breaking\nThe Higgs potential—the field giving mass to particles and ensuring protons don’t decay so life can exist—obtains a condensate during the electroweak epoch. The potential is given by:\n  \nV(\\phi) = \\mu^2 |\\phi|^2 + \\lambda |\\phi|^4  \n\nwhere \\phi is the Higgs field, \\mu^2 &lt; 0 triggers symmetry breaking, and \\lambda is the self-coupling constant.\n\n\n\nEssentially, let me start with the electroweak epoch, where the Higgs potential forms a condensate. The field that drives electroweak physics fills the entire space, creating a condensate of the Higgs field. Through this condensate, particles are slowed down, gain inertia, and obtain mass—this is the Higgs mechanism. The process of the potential evolving is called spontaneous symmetry breaking, where one of the minima is peaked. That’s how I like thinking about the electroweak stage.\n\nThen, particles have masses, the universe starts evolving, and at some point, we arrive at the quark epoch, where the universe is filled with a quark-gluon plasma. Essentially, quarks and gluons make an unstructured soup of objects—quarks, gluons, and more. There is nothing about structure formation yet; it’s just quarks disturbing. There is no scale to discuss yet. Quarks and gluons are together, and the universe is extremely hot. From that moment, it starts cooling down. At some point, the temperature is low enough that this medium starts separating, and we arrive at the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) epoch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNuclear Size Scaling\nThe radius R of a nucleus scales with the number of nucleons A as:\n  \nR \\approx r_0 A^{1/3}  \n\nwhere r_0 \\approx 1.2 \\, \\text{fm} (Fermi).\n\n\n\nThis medium starts forming small volumes where quark and gluon interactions bind to a scalable level. If you think of this, you’d need two years to learn it in detail. This comes in particle physics, introductory nuclear physics, and specialized courses on QCD or statistical mechanics. You could have a special course on QCD at finite temperature, since it’s a heated medium with different laws applied to what we’ll discuss for strong interactions.\n\nHydrogen is what we’ll focus on now. But if you think of how quickly this happened, you’ll be slightly surprised. Essentially, this is… do you have a guess? 10^{-36} seconds (Planck), 10^{-12} (electroweak), 10^{-6}, then 10^{-3}, and finally 1 second. Imagine there was nothing, and then the time it takes for sound to reach you when I clap—about 10 milliseconds—by that time, we’d already passed through all these stages and everything had formed. That’s how quickly the universe evolved.\n\nThe rest of the timeline to the present 13.8 billion years has other interesting physics, but not as intense from the perspective of hadron physics. Hadrons are objects where strong interactions are confined to a scale of a few femtometers (10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}). There’s essentially nothing around—just small chunks of volume where quarks and gluons interact. By colliding hadrons, we study their internal structure, but there’s no natural scale smaller than this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProton Mass Decomposition\nThe proton mass m_p is dominated by QCD energy (gluon condensate):\n  \nm_p \\approx 938 \\, \\text{MeV}, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad m_{\\text{quarks}} \\sim 9 \\, \\text{MeV} \\quad (\\text{only} \\sim 1\\%)  \n\nThe remainder arises from strong interaction energy.\n\n\n\nConcerning empty space, let’s sketch one of the most common elements on Earth. From the periodic table, what is it? Oxygen. Oxygen-16 (or 18) has 8 protons and 8 (or 10) neutrons. The geometry of this atom is a core of protons and neutrons, with electrons compensating the charge. The nucleus scales as the number of nucleons to the power of 1/3 (volume scaling). Packing 16 nucleons gives a radius of about 3 fm. Electrons, however, have wave functions 3 orders of magnitude larger (~50 picometers). This shows how empty space is—a tiny core surrounded by vast electron space with no strong interactions.\n\nNow, the fundamental hardware: the Standard Model describes most known interactions (excluding neutrinos’ open questions). The part responsible for strong interactions is quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The participants are quarks and gluons, the only particles carrying color charge—similar to electric charge but distinct. Color charge is a quantum number; we describe it via color wave functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQCD and QED Lagrangians\nThe Lagrangian density for QCD is:\n  \n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{QCD}} = \\bar{\\psi}_i (i \\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m) \\psi_i - \\frac{1}{4} G^a_{\\mu\\nu} G_a^{\\mu\\nu}  \n\nwhere D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - i g_s A_\\mu^a T^a and G^a_{\\mu\\nu} is the gluon field strength.\nFor QED:\n  \n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{QED}} = \\bar{\\psi} (i \\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m) \\psi - \\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu}  \n\nwhere D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - i e A_\\mu.\n\n\n\nOther Standard Model particles (electrons, muons, taus, photons, neutrinos) don’t carry color charge and don’t interact strongly. Quarks come in six types: up (charge +2/3), down (-1/3), charm, strange, top, bottom. They’re grouped by generation (light: u/d; heavier: s/c; heaviest: t/b). Most matter is made of first-generation quarks. Strange quarks may affect neutron star equations of state. Charm and bottom are studied in high-energy collisions; the top quark’s lifetime is too short for hadronization.\n\nHadrons are classified as mesons (quark-antiquark) or baryons (three quarks). At the chiral symmetry breaking scale, gluons condense, dressing quarks and giving them effective mass. The proton’s mass is ~1 GeV, but the Higgs contributes only ~1% (3 MeV per quark); 99% comes from QCD energy (gluon condensate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural Units Conversion\nIn natural units (\\hbar = c = 1):\n  \n1 \\, \\text{GeV}^{-1} \\approx 0.197 \\, \\text{fm}, \\quad 1 \\, \\text{GeV} \\approx 1.783 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{kg}  \n\nRelating energy, mass, and length scales.\n\n\n\nNow, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and quantum electrodynamics (QED) share a Lagrangian framework. QED’s Lagrangian is:\n  \n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{QED}} = \\bar{\\psi} (i \\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m) \\psi - \\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu},  \n\nwhere D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - i e A_\\mu. Maxwell’s equations in covariant form are \\partial_\\mu F^{\\mu\\nu} = j^\\nu. QCD’s Lagrangian adds color charge:\n  \n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{QCD}} = \\bar{\\psi}_i (i \\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m) \\psi_i - \\frac{1}{4} G^a_{\\mu\\nu} G_a^{\\mu\\nu},  \n\nwith D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - i g_s A_\\mu^a T^a and G^a_{\\mu\\nu} as the gluon field strength.\nNatural units (\\hbar = c = 1) simplify conversions: 1 \\, \\text{GeV}^{-1} \\approx 0.197 \\, \\text{fm}; 1 \\, \\text{GeV} \\approx 1.78 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{kg}.\n\n\n0.3 Einstein Notation, Gauge Invariance, and Fermion Interactions in Field Theory\nAnother thing to note is that here I am explicitly using Einstein notation and summing over repeated indices.\n\n\\mu here, \\mu there—they are repeated.\n\nThis means that if I were precise, I should have written here a sum from \\mu=1 to 4 over all components.\n\nThe \\nu is a repeated index again, so we sum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummation Example: For F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}, expanding the sum yields 4 \\times 4 = 16 terms (4 components per index). If multiplied by another term with 4 components, the total becomes 16 \\times 4 = 64 terms.\n\n\n\n\nThe equation of motion for this Lagrangian is obtained using the Euler-Lagrange equation.\n\nYou might remember this from classical mechanics where we had dots, and the first term was the time derivative, the second was the derivative of the field.\n\nEssentially, we treat the Lagrangian as a function of the field derivatives and the fields themselves as independent objects.\n\nFirst, we differentiate with respect to the derivatives, and then with respect to the fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight: In classical mechanics, these would be the momentum terms, but here they are field variables. The index \\mu is summed over—a simple summation.\n\n\n\nThe derivative is with respect to A_\\rho (another index convention). If I take this Lagrangian, where everything is defined, and use the Euler-Lagrange equation, I get the equation of motion describing how the field propagates through space. We know this gives Maxwell’s equations.\n\nNow let me introduce the second part. This was the gauge field. Let me label it 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nThis is a less intuitive concept that you might not have seen before, but we will need it.\n\nThere are degrees of freedom that are not fixed for photons in the electromagnetic field, and there is an arbitrary gauge choice we can make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGauge Transformation:\n  \nA_\\mu \\rightarrow A'_\\mu = A_\\mu - \\partial_\\mu \\chi  \n\nwhere \\chi is an arbitrary scalar field. Under this, F_{\\mu\\nu} remains invariant: F'_{\\mu\\nu} = F_{\\mu\\nu}.\n\n\n\nThis is a symmetry of the Lagrangian—the gauge symmetry. If you derive Maxwell’s equations from the Lagrangian, you’ll get them up to a gauge term. By fixing the gauge, you recover the standard Maxwell equations.\n\nNow we introduce fermion fields.\n\nIn electrodynamics, our leptons are described by the Dirac field \\psi, a four-component spinor (not a four-vector).\n\nThe Lagrangian is a scalar quantity—no free indices—and is constructed from objects of different dimensionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpinor Properties:\n- \\psi describes spin-1/2 particles with four components (particle + antiparticle).\n- The adjoint spinor is \\bar{\\psi} = \\psi^\\dagger \\gamma^0.\n- The Dirac Lagrangian:\n  \n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Dirac}} = \\bar{\\psi} (i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m) \\psi  \n\n\n\n\nThe equation of motion is the Dirac equation: (i\\not{\\partial} - m)\\psi = 0 (using Feynman slash notation).\n\nTo introduce interactions, we use gauge invariance.\n- For fermions, gauge invariance means changing the phase of \\psi locally at every space-time point.\n- The tricky part is that \\partial_\\mu \\psi introduces extra terms under a space-dependent phase transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovariant Derivative Fix:\nReplace \\partial_\\mu with D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu + ieA_\\mu. Under simultaneous transformations of \\psi and A_\\mu, the Lagrangian remains invariant.\n\n\n\nThis is the essence of QED: interactions arise from requiring invariance under local phase transformations.\n\nThe same principle applies to other gauge theories (e.g., SU(2) for electroweak, SU(3) for QCD).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Difference in QCD:\n- Gluons self-interact due to non-Abelian structure (terms like f^{abc} in G^a_{\\mu\\nu}).\n- Coupling runs with energy: asymptotic freedom (weak at high energy) vs. confinement (strong at low energy).\n\n\n\n\nFinally, in perturbation theory, we compute scattering amplitudes using Feynman diagrams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-Section and Decay Width:\n- Cross-section:\n  \n\\sigma = \\frac{1}{2E_A 2E_B |v_A - v_B|} \\int |\\mathcal{M}|^2 \\, d\\Pi_{\\text{phase space}}  \n\n- Decay width:\n  \n\\Gamma = \\frac{1}{2m} \\int |\\mathcal{M}|^2 \\, d\\Pi_{\\text{phase space}}  \n\n\n\n\nThese connect field theory to measurable quantities in experiments.\n\n\n0.4 Course Logistics, Exam Details, and Summer School Opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture & Exercise Schedule\nIt’s really nice to have a watch today.

Bochum: 2 weeks (for advanced students)\n- Applications are open for a few more weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Description Access\nFor the course description… Well, in order to proceed, just write an email, and I can forward you the announcement. I think I sent it to Fast Shaft, but I’m not sure it was propagated. These are super exciting events if you want to know more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo physics formulas were discussed in this segment. The focus was on administrative and organizational details.\n\n\n\n\n\n0.5 Collaborative Problem-Solving, Resource Use, and Course Logistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaboration is encouraged! Feel free to discuss and solve the sheets together. Use any resources you find helpful—ChatGPT, books, or other materials. The problems are standard and designed for learning, not assessment. How you learn is up to you.\n\n\n\n\nThe lecturer follows several key texts:\n1. Hudson Martin (first reference)\n2. Martin Schemer\n3. Thomson’s Particle Physics (general particle physics)\n4. Martin Spearman (dedicated to Hadron Physics)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise groups start this week with three class problems.\n\nSheets distribution: Two pages per sheet, 15 printed. Take one for yourself and extras for friends.\n\n“Before leaving, please take the sheets. We should stamp them together, but make sure you don’t miss one.”\n\n“Do you have a quarter of the sheet?

Hope we survive to the end of the semester!”\n\nExercises are not obligatory, but “everyone has to do the work.”\n\n“You’re gonna have troubles to get people to the board because this is not private.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming focus:\n- Reintroducing the QED Lagrangian:\n\\mathcal{L}_{QED} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m)\\psi - \\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}\nWhere D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu + ieA_\\mu (covariant derivative).\n- Comparing QED (electromagnetic interactions) and QCD (added complexity).\n“Starting with a simpler case and explaining how to calculate terms is a good starting point.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly four students from the department are enrolled.\n\n“I don’t like the whiteboard in the office—it’s too small. You get used to it.”\n\n“No, you can stay there. That’s still not a big… I think we go right.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLecturer’s reflection: “I’ve done this exercise for QED and wonder if people grasp the complications QCD brings.”\n\nKey takeaway: QED explains most electromagnetic interactions, while QCD introduces non-abelian gauge symmetry challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n“I rushed at the beginning and end, so you’ll have to explain stuff. We’ll calculate something for QED if time permits.”"

    "text": "0.1 Symmetries in Hadron Physics and Estimating Hadronic Cross Sections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecap of Previous Lecture\nThe homework problems last week were deemed too easy, so we’ll increase the problem level this week. Some problems recur across courses—like Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which appear in nuclear physics, particle physics, and quantum field theory. This week’s homework will include them, but they should be manageable.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll explore:\n\nQCD with the SU group (as previously discussed).\n\nThe phenomenology of the SU flavor group, including:\n\nIsospin\n\nSU flavor by interchanging u/d and squarks.\n\n\nConnection to the Lorentz group, where SU(2) is a subgroup responsible for rotations.\n\nYou’ll see how spin addition relates to quark addition inside hadrons. This builds on quantum mechanics material you’ve already seen, and I hope it’s easy to follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a particularly enjoyable section because the spin algebra can be derived independently—just isolate yourself from books and the internet, and you can work through it elegantly.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start with a question from last lecture:\nHow would you estimate the typical cross section of hadronic reactions?\nThe exact approach involves:\n\\sigma = \\frac{1}{F} \\int |\\mathcal{M}|^2 \\, d\\Phi\nwhere:\n\n\\sigma = cross section\n\nF = flux factor\n\n\\mathcal{M} = matrix element\n\nd\\Phi = phase space differential\n\nThis gives the exact value in inverse GeV (convertible to cm²).\n\nBut what’s the scale? We’re dealing with barns (1\\,\\text{barn} = 10^{-24}\\,\\text{cm}^2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight: The cross section represents the effective interaction area. For a proton (radius ~1\\,\\text{fm} = 10^{-13}\\,\\text{cm}):\n\\sigma \\approx \\pi r^2 = \\pi (10^{-13}\\,\\text{cm})^2 \\approx 3 \\times 10^{-26}\\,\\text{cm}^2 \\approx 30\\,\\text{mb}\n\n\n\nThis is the typical scale for hadronic reactions. The strong interaction is powerful but short-range—particles must overlap to interact.\n\n\n0.2 Charge Definitions in QED and QCD, and Introduction to SU(2) Group Theory\nThe second question addressed is how to define charge in QED and QCD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn QED, the electric charge is physical and conserved. It corresponds to a symmetry, as per Noether’s theorem, which guarantees a conserved current. The charge is defined as the integral of the zero component of this current:\n Q = \\int d^3x \\, J^0 = \\int d^3x \\, \\psi^\\dagger \\psi. \n\n\n\nFor a Dirac field, \\bar{\\psi}\\psi involves conjugation with \\gamma^0, yielding \\psi^\\dagger \\psi—a positive quantity. This implies that if \\psi represents an electron, it has a positive charge. However, this is a convention:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe observed charge Q is matched to -e for electrons to align with experimental conventions. The current in QED is:\n J^\\mu = -e \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\psi. \nThe -e ensures consistency with standard definitions, but the conservation of the quantity is the key takeaway from field theory.\n\n\n\n\nThe approach in QCD is analogous but involves color indices and generators of SU(3):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe QCD current for color charge is:\n J^\\mu_a = \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu T_a \\psi, \nwhere T_a are the Gell-Mann matrices (generators of SU(3)). Unlike QED, quarks have eight color charges, corresponding to the gluon probes.\n\n\n\nFor example, given a quark field \\psi_{\\text{color}} = (1, 2, i\\sqrt{3}), its charge is an eight-component vector—each component depends on the gluon used to probe it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis structure arises from group theory: QED uses U(1), while QCD uses SU(3). Today, we’ll also discuss SU(2), which shares similar principles.\n\n\n\n\nThe SU(2) group is fundamental in particle physics. It is a special unitary group of 2 \\times 2 matrices with determinant one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor U \\in SU(2), the conditions are:\n U U^\\dagger = I \\quad \\text{and} \\quad U^\\dagger U = I. \nThe determinant is restricted to 1 (the “S” in SU(2)).\n\n\n\n\nInverse: If g \\in SU(2), then g^{-1} \\in SU(2).\nClosure: For g_1, g_2 \\in SU(2), g_1 g_2 \\in SU(2).\n\nIdentity: The identity matrix I is included.\n\nAny SU(2) element can be written as:\n U = \\exp\\left(-i \\alpha_a \\sigma_a / 2\\right), \nwhere \\sigma_a are the Pauli matrices:\n \\sigma_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\sigma_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\sigma_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor nilpotent matrices, the exponential simplifies. For example:\n \\exp\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = I + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}. \n\n\n\n\nIn quantum mechanics, spin operators J_i satisfy:\n [J_i, J_j] = i \\epsilon_{ijk} J_k. \nThe raising/lowering operators are:\n J_\\pm = J_1 \\pm i J_2, \nacting on states |j, m\\rangle as:\n J_\\pm |j, m\\rangle = \\sqrt{j(j+1) - m(m \\pm 1)} \\, |j, m \\pm 1\\rangle. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eigenvalues are:\n J^2 |j, m\\rangle = j(j+1) |j, m\\rangle, \\quad J_3 |j, m\\rangle = m |j, m\\rangle. \n\n\n\nFor quark states (e.g., \\Xi particles), flavor symmetry treats u and d quarks similarly due to nearly equal masses (m_u \\approx m_d \\approx 3 \\text{MeV}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\Xi_{cc} (with ccu or ccd) shows a puzzling mass difference, violating the expected SU(2) symmetry. This remains a hot topic in particle physics.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve covered:\n\nCharge definitions in QED and QCD.\n\nSU(2) group theory and its generators.\n\nApplications to spin and flavor symmetry.\n\nNext, we’ll delve deeper into SU(2) representations and their role in particle physics.\n\n\n0.3 Symmetries of the QCD Lagrangian and Quark Mass Hierarchy\nWhen we speak about the symmetries of the Lagrangian of QCD, we have in mind the Lagrangian itself. It consists of two key terms:\n\nGluon term: Describes the dynamics of the gluon fields.\nQuark term: The Dirac term, which includes a mass parameter for the quarks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe QCD Lagrangian is given by: \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{QCD}} = -\\frac{1}{4}G^{a}_{\\mu u}G^{a\\mu u} + \\sum_{f}\\bar{\\psi}_f(i\\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m_f)\\psi_f where:\n\nG^{a}_{\\mu u} is the gluon field strength tensor,\n\\psi_f represents quark fields of flavor f,\nm_f are the quark masses,\nD_\\mu is the covariant derivative.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the quark masses are not the same, the mass term will break the symmetry. For the u and d quarks, since their masses are almost identical (m_u \\approx m_d), the symmetry is not broken by the mass terms, and this remains a good symmetry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mass term in the Lagrangian is: \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{mass}} = -\\sum_{f=u,d,s} m_f \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f When m_u \\approx m_d, this preserves an approximate SU(2) isospin symmetry.\n\n\n\n\n\n0.4 Combining Isospin and Spin Representations in SU(2)\nGroup.\nThis is so ud. Let me sketch this like this: U to D. Rotation in the space is a good scene. Then my cascade particle would be in that case, if I consider U and D to be the same particle as the SSL where L is the number in the ISIS spin wave function. It’s clear that cascade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cascade particle is historically named due to its decay pattern. While its original name is difficult to pronounce (except by Greek speakers), it’s universally referred to as “cascade” in particle physics.\n\n\n\nLet me also introduce the language that you might not be familiar with: Cascade is the same as this guy. It’s just historically people saw this guy decaying in the cascade of particles. That’s why. And no one can actually pronounce this correctly except Greek people. So if you want to make sure you spell it correctly, call it cascade. Everyone calls it cascade.\nThe cascade particle is now a single particle in our consideration with respect to the strong interaction and has ISIS spin wave function. This is very similar to the spin. We again have a two-dimensional vector space in which we can act with the group elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SU(2) Rotation Operator for isospin transformations is given by:\n  \nU = e^{-i \\alpha \\cdot \\mathbf{G}}  \n\nwhere \\mathbf{G} are the generators of SU(2) and \\alpha are rotation parameters.\n\n\n\nSo U is equal to e^{-i\\alpha G}. Then what is the charge of the group of this vector? Take it in right? You put it to the equation for the charge and then we get essentially now it’s clear what the spin stands for.\nIsospin is the same way as the spin would give one half for this and minus one. You get it right? Acting well, it’s a doublet corresponds to the two components. The dimension of the representation is 2, it corresponds to the spin or isospin 1/2. We just counted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Isospin Doublet Representation for u and d quarks is:\n  \n\\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\text{isospin } I = \\frac{1}{2}  \n\n\n\n\nSo if I get a multiplet of four dimensions, what would be the isospin? Okay, let’s come back. Four dimensions is three half. If it’s 95 dimensions, it’ll be 47.\nNow you might wonder, wait a second, how do we get more than two? We’ve got two quarks, right? U and D. How do we get more dimensions if we are not…\nI mentioned here that in grouping mock quarks actually changes the group. We are going to consider a different group. It will be SU. We are not talking about SU. Now we stick with the SU and we only permute two unique quarks.\nHow do we get higher representations, higher dimensions, more particles? Exactly. The next word: combining particles, combining representations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan Series for combining two spin-1/2 particles is:\n  \n\\frac{1}{2} \\otimes \\frac{1}{2} = 0 \\oplus 1  \n\n\n\n\nThe higher dimension of representations appear when I start combining considering particles more than one quark. Because in that case I have to deal with the polling situation. There is one system. There is another system with spin one half. But I want to consider them as a system, as a combined system. And I want to characterize the total system by the total either spin or isospin and the projection.\nIn that case for SU, we are still sitting with the SU2 group. You can think of the system as a system of two vectors. The total spin of the system has again constantly. And the total J is one of the numbers from…\nDon’t remember that. Just think of the vector you have in one hand, one vector with J1, another hand, another vector with G2. And you want to obtain some of them in our regular vector space. In our regular vector sense, you want to take one and then you stick the other one right.\nThe resulting vector can have different lengths depending on the angle between these two. But there are minimal and maximal values. And all values in between are possible, but they have to contain them. Essentially that’s what’s written here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe General Spin Addition Rule is:\n  \nj_1 \\otimes j_2 = |j_1 - j_2| \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus (j_1 + j_2)  \n\nExample: For j_1 = 3, j_2 = 2:\n  \n3 \\otimes 2 = 1 \\oplus 2 \\oplus 3 \\oplus 4 \\oplus 5  \n\n\n\n\nThe minimum you obtain by combining in this direction and then maximum combining and all intermediate values are possible. What we have here is combining the 1/2. Let’s know the notations that we often use. That tells you you combine two vector spaces coming from the cross product to the irreducible representations.\nYou combine spin 1/2 and spin 1/2. The total system can have spin 0 or 1. Let’s do exactly another example. We combine spin 3 and spin 2. What do I get? Just anyone output 5 or 55 again? Yes, 5, 4, 3, 1, 2. Put plus.\nWhat amazed me is that the dimension on the left and right is the same. Can we count that? This would be common dimensional 3. Spin 3 is 7, spin 2 is 5. Here is 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Can someone tell me if it works or not? It might.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimension Check for Representations:\nFor the combination 3 \\otimes 2:\n  \n\\text{Dim}(3) \\times \\text{Dim}(2) = 7 \\times 5 = 35  \n\n  \n\\text{Dim}(1) + \\text{Dim}(2) + \\text{Dim}(3) + \\text{Dim}(4) + \\text{Dim}(5) = 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 35  \n\n\n\n\nRight, 20, 35 on the left, 35 on the right. Isn’t it amazing? We just, I mean probably formally prove that by counting all intermediate states from one to another. But that tells you the way to check yourself if you want to combine spins and write it with recombinations.\nYou can always count dimensions and see what essentially we do when we map this to that. Here we have a vector. The basis in this dimension is the… Let’s say 1, 1. This is an example of the 7 into 7 and then this is 5. This is one unit vector in that dimension.\nIn that case I have a 35 dimensional vector which has blocks. The first block is 3, 3 is the second block, 3. The second block is 5, 7, 9, 11. So I have blocks. We map this to that.\nMoreover, what group theory tells you is that these blocks did not talk to each other. Once you put this exponent and then consider matrix that acts on these 35 dimensional spaces, it will rotate different components within the box. They won’t talk to each other. That’s called representation.\nFor us it’s different sectors that give a total spin. If I have a system with total spin equals to say three, there is no rotation that would change the spin to four. That’s super clear, right? Under rotations the spin is preserved.\nThe implication in mathematics is that there is a representation that has a block diagonal form of the interaction where the blocks don’t talk to each other. Now we know how to combine.\nBefore doing a few practical combinations, let’s introduce part in charge conjugation quickly. I think we are good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it clear that what we discussed about spin is the same applied to isospin? Often in particle physics you deal with both and one shouldn’t mix them up.\n\n\n\nWe deal with isospin when you construct the quark wave function. But when you combine particles with spin and want to understand angular dependence, you’re dealing with spin. With rotational group, the same algebra, the same methods, everything is the same.\nJust keep in mind whether you’re talking about flavor SU(2) or Lorentz part of the Lorentz Group rotational SU(2).\n\n\n0.5 Parity, Charge Conjugation, and Composite Systems in Particle States\nNumber 3, 4, 5 in our discussion: the parity operator performs space inversion with respect to the origin. Both parity and charge conjugation act on a state and produce another state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parity operator \\mathcal{P} inverts spatial coordinates:\n\\mathcal{P} \\psi(\\vec{r}) = \\eta_P \\psi(-\\vec{r}), \\quad \\eta_P = \\pm 1\nwhere \\eta_P is the intrinsic parity eigenvalue.\n\n\n\nThe parity answers how the wave function changes when flipped through the origin. Intuitively, flipping a vector through the origin reverses all spatial components. For any particle, you can determine its parity. Acting twice with parity returns the original state, so the eigenvalue is modulo 1 (conventionally \\pm 1).\n\nCharge conjugation flips all charges, converting a particle to its antiparticle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charge conjugation operator \\mathcal{C} acts as:\n\\mathcal{C} |\\psi\\rangle = \\eta_C |\\overline{\\psi}\\rangle, \\quad \\eta_C = \\pm 1\nFor neutral eigenstates (e.g., \\pi^0), \\eta_C is defined, but charged particles (e.g., \\pi^+) are not eigenstates since \\mathcal{C} \\pi^+ = \\pi^-.\n\n\n\nThe prime notation here indicates the antiparticle. By convention, charge conjugation is defined for the neutral member of a multiplet (e.g., \\pi^0). The Particle Data Group lists J^{PC} (spin, parity, charge conjugation) for all particles. For \\pi^0, J^{PC} = 0^{-+}; for \\pi^+, charge conjugation is assigned by analogy to \\pi^0.\n\nTo find J^{PC} for a composite system:\n\nTotal J: Use spin algebra.\n\nParity: Multiplicative, including (-1)^L for orbital angular momentum L.\n\nCharge Conjugation: Multiplicative (for neutral systems, C = (-1)^{L+S}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParity of a composite system:\nP = \\eta_{P1} \\eta_{P2} (-1)^L\nwhere \\eta_{P1}, \\eta_{P2} are intrinsic parities.\n\n\n\nExample: For L = 0, combine spins multiplicatively (e.g., 1/2 + 0 = 1/2). For L = 1, add one unit of angular momentum, with parity (-1)^{L+1}.\n\nIn the quark model, heavy quarks (e.g., charm) are treated without gluons. The u and d quarks form isospin multiplets:\n\nIsospin 1: Symmetric combination.\n\nIsospin 0: Antisymmetric combination (matched with antisymmetric spin wave function).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor baryons like \\Lambda_c (isospin-0), excitations include radial (n=1s, 2s) or orbital (P-wave, D-wave) modes. The Particle Data Group lists ~7 \\Lambda_c states, including ground and excited configurations.\n\n\n\n\nKey skill: Determine allowed L in decays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecay selection rules: For A \\to B + C, allowed L satisfies:\n|J_B - J_C| \\leq L \\leq J_B + J_C \\quad \\text{and} \\quad P_A = P_B P_C (-1)^L.\nExample: 0^+ \\to 1^- + 2^- requires L=2 (D-wave) to conserve J^P.\n\n\n\n\nNeglecting spins, sketch the energy spectrum for n \\leq 3 (1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3d). Recall L &lt; n (no f-waves).\n\nThanks for attending! Questions are welcome—ask directly or anonymously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice: Constructing J^P tables and decay L assignments are essential skills for particle physics."

    "text": "7 Constructing Quark Flavor Basis Functions\nWe now examine the irreducible representation of the z quarks. The dimensionality of the isospin matrix acting on three quarks is determined by the isospin space I = 3/2. For SU(2), there are no decuplets or octets — those belong to SU(3). However, the combination rules remain analogous.\nFor example, the combination UUU has isospin I_3 = 3/2, while DDD has I_3 = -3/2. Intermediate states like UUD and UDD correspond to I_3 = 1/2 and I_3 = -1/2, respectively.\nTo construct the quark flavor basis functions, we start with the state of maximum spin or flavor, which is |3/2, 3/2\\rangle (using spin or flavor notation equivalently). We then apply the lowering operator J_- to generate the remaining states. The action of the lowering operator is given by:\n\nJ_- |j, m\\rangle = \\sqrt{j(j+1) - m(m-1)} \\ |j, m-1\\rangle\n\nFor the case where j = m = 3/2, this simplifies to:\n\nJ_- |3/2, 3/2\\rangle = \\sqrt{3} \\ |3/2, 1/2\\rangle\n\nThe lowering operator J_- can be decomposed into individual quark operators:\n\nJ_- = J_-^{(1)} \\otimes \\mathbb{I}^{(2)} \\otimes \\mathbb{I}^{(3)} + \\mathbb{I}^{(1)} \\otimes J_-^{(2)} \\otimes \\mathbb{I}^{(3)} + \\mathbb{I}^{(1)} \\otimes \\mathbb{I}^{(2)} \\otimes J_-^{(3)}\n\nWhen applied to UUU, this yields a superposition of states like UUD, ensuring proper normalization. The normalization condition requires that:\n\n\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = 1\n\nThis is enforced using orthogonality relations: identical quark flavors (e.g., UU) are normalized, while different flavors (e.g., UD) are orthogonal.\nWe can continue applying the lowering operator to generate the full multiplet, including states with I_3 = -3/2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe antiparticle of \\Xi_c^+ is not \\Xi_c^- but rather \\overline{\\Xi_c^-}.

The wave function for this state is a combination like u^2(3ud + u du + e du), and another term like (dud + d du + u du). This is straightforward for the highest spin state.\nRecall that we previously discussed spin S = 47, which gives a dimensionality of 95. To build this from spin 1/2 particles, we need 94 spin 1/2 particles — essentially 94 “legs.” If we want to generate the 95-dimensional space (or 333, referring to the E_z basis), we simply apply the lowering operator 62 times. This process can be automated.\nThe situation becomes more complicated when considering intermediate spins, such as 90. Combining 94 spin 1/2 particles allows for various total spin states. Can we get spin 0? Yes. Can we get spin 1? Yes. All intermediate spins are possible, with different multiplicities.\nThe dimensionality of the matrix acting on this space is 2^{94}, since each spin 1/2 particle contributes a 2-dimensional representation. This can be written as a tensor product:\n\n2 \\otimes 2 \\otimes 2 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes 2 \\quad (\\text{94 times})\n\nThis space decomposes into irreducible representations, corresponding to different spin combinations.

However, constructing the other basis vectors requires more care.\nFor the 1/2 and 3/2 isospin states, we have 4-plets and 2-plets.

For normalization, squaring this gives:\n\n1 + 1 + 4 = 6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{Normalization factor} \\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\n\nTo construct the basis function for the 1/2 state with projection -1/2, we act with the lowering operator on the upper state. This yields:\n\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\left( |d u d\\rangle + |u d d\\rangle - 2 |d d u\\rangle \\right)\n\nThe lowering operator acts as follows:\n\nOn |u d u\\rangle, it gives |d d u\\rangle + |u d d\\rangle.\n\nOn |u u d\\rangle, it gives |d u d\\rangle + |u d d\\rangle.\n\nOn |d u u\\rangle, it gives 0 (since lowering |d\\rangle gives zero).\n\nCombining these terms, we get:\n\n|d u d\\rangle + |u d d\\rangle + |u d d\\rangle - 2 |d d u\\rangle = |d u d\\rangle + 2 |u d d\\rangle - 2 |d d u\\rangle\n\nAfter normalization, this confirms the orthogonal basis construction.\nThe 8 \\times 8 matrix acting on these states decomposes into blocks:\n\nA 4 \\times 4 block (for the 3/2 multiplet).\n\nTwo 2 \\times 2 blocks (for the 1/2 multiplets).\n\nAnother 2 \\times 2 block (for the remaining states).\n\nThis block-diagonal structure reflects the irreducible representations of the spin space."

    "text": "12 Combining Spins and Constructing Representations\nWe start with a system of four spins, then reduce it to two. After removing redundant lines, we are left with three cups (states), five, and another one. By examining the representation, we identify two basis vectors: |1\\rangle and |2\\rangle. The third basis vector must be orthogonal to both, such as |1, -1, 0\\rangle.\nFor the first vector, we have |u t\\rangle - |u d u\\rangle. The lower state is obtained by applying the lowering operator. While 94 might seem excessive, it illustrates the process for spin systems.\nNext, we consider spin-2 systems, which are more complicated. The framework applies not only to half-integer spins but also to integer spins. When combining two spin-1 systems, we use spin algebra to determine the possible states, ranging from the lowest (spin-0) to the highest (spin-2).\nWe verify the dimensionality by checking:\n\n3 + 3 = 1 + 3 + 5\n\nThis confirms the decomposition into irreducible representations. We begin constructing the basis with the simplest case, using the volume operator. The ladder operator now involves four combinations:\n\n|0, 0\\rangle, \\ |+\\rangle, \\ |-\\rangle, \\ |+\\ +\\rangle\n\nFor the total spin-2 state, we have:\n\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |+\\ +\\rangle - |-\\ -\\rangle \\right)\n\nTo ensure orthogonality, we introduce a minus sign. Care must be taken when applying lowering operators, as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients may vary. For binary systems, these coefficients are identical.\nThe normalization factor is \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, and we proceed by constructing orthogonal vectors in the spin space."

    "section": "14 Proton Wave Function and Symmetry Considerations",
    "text": "14 Proton Wave Function and Symmetry Considerations\nThe proton wave function must be constructed in the product of four spaces: color, space, isospin, and spin. The general form is a sum over components in these spaces, not a simple product:\n\n\\Psi = \\sum_i \\Psi_{\\text{space}} \\otimes \\Psi_{\\text{isospin}} \\otimes \\Psi_{\\text{spin}}\n\nHowever, the color wave function is a singlet (scalar) and can be factored out:\n\n\\Psi = \\Psi_{\\text{color}} \\otimes \\sum_i \\Psi_{\\text{isospin}} \\otimes \\Psi_{\\text{spin}}\n\nThere is also an argument that the space wave function is a scalar and can be factored out, though this requires justification from the literature. The remaining parts — isospin and spin — are generally not factorizable and must be treated as entangled components.\nTo understand the internal structure of hadrons, we need the proton wave function. Similarly, the delta baryon wave function will be addressed in homework, but it may be simpler to start with its symmetries.\nThe baryon wave function must be color-neutral, as all hadrons are. It depends on spatial coordinates (x, t), isospin, and spin. These components are not independent in the general case; the wave function lives in the product of these spaces and can mix them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe color wave function is a singlet, meaning it has no internal dimensionality and can be separated. The space wave function is also argued to be a scalar, though this requires further verification.\n\n\n\nFor spin and isospin, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are essential for combining states.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is lecture number 4. We will have no exercise session this week due to the trip to CERN. There is also a scheduling issue for next week’s exercise class, as Thursday is a holiday. I hope Ilya can discuss rescheduling it to another day. Skipping two weeks would be too much, but we will be back from CERN on Monday, and the next lecture will proceed as planned on Tuesday.\nToday’s lecture will focus on experiments in spectroscopy and kinematics computations. Before diving into that, let’s recap the last lecture and address two key questions:\n\nCompute the magnetic moment in the current model of the Omega baryon.\n\nCompute the lowest 1s multiplet excitation of the \\Sigma_p parameter (related to ISIS spin factors).\n\nFor question 1, we first need the quark content of the \\Omega^- baryon: three strange quarks (sss). The total wave function is a product of color, isospin, spin, and flavor components, but color and isospin are factored out, leaving only flavor and spin. The flavor part is trivial, so we focus on spin.\nThe spin configuration must yield a total spin of 3/2 for the \\Omega^- baryon, with parity +. This implies orbital angular momentum L = 1, and the spin must be 1/2 to achieve the correct total angular momentum J = 3/2.\nFor question 2, the 1s multiplet excitation of \\Sigma_p involves understanding the spin structure of the system, particularly how the spin states align to form the lowest-energy configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\Omega^- baryon’s magnetic moment arises from the contributions of its three strange quarks, each with spin 1/2. The total spin configuration must be symmetric to match the observed J = 3/2 state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen computing the 1s multiplet, remember that the lowest-energy state corresponds to the most symmetric spin arrangement, minimizing repulsive interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parity of the Omega baryon is plus, which implies the orbital angular momentum L = 1. The spin is 3/2, giving a total angular momentum J = 3/2. The multiplicity of the spin-3/2 state is four, corresponding to the four possible projections along the z-axis: +3/2, +1/2, -1/2, -3/2.\nThe wave function for the \\Omega^- baryon is constructed from the spin states of the three strange quarks. Acting with the lowering operator on the highest weight state generates the other components, such as |\\downarrow\\uparrow\\uparrow\\rangle, |\\uparrow\\downarrow\\uparrow\\rangle, and |\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle, each with a coefficient of 1/\\sqrt{3}.\nThe magnetic moment operator is given by:\n\n\\mu_z = \\mu_{1z} + \\mu_{2z} + \\mu_{3z}\n\nWhen applied to the state, it acts as an eigenoperator. For example, \\mu_{1z} acting on |\\uparrow\\uparrow\\uparrow\\rangle returns the spin projection multiplied by the charge factor. The charge of each strange quark is -1/3, so the total charge contribution is:\n\n\\mu \\propto \\sum_{i=1}^3 q_i \\cdot s_{iz}\n\nFor the \\Omega^- baryon, the total charge is -1, and the dominant contribution comes from the spin alignment. The magnetic moment is then:\n\n\\mu \\approx \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_s c}\n\nwhere m_s is the mass of the strange quark (approximately 500 MeV). Compared to the electron’s magnetic moment, this is smaller by a factor of 10^3 due to the larger mass of the strange quark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\Omega^- baryon’s magnetic moment is determined by the spin and charge contributions of its three strange quarks, with the mass scale set by the strange quark mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen computing magnetic moments, focus on the highest weight state first, as the other states can be generated using ladder operators. The proportionality to spin simplifies the calculation.\n\n\n\nThe charge of the \\Omega^- baryon is -1, arising from the sum of the three strange quark charges. The magnetic moment is thus suppressed relative to the electron due to the heavier mass scale involved.\n\n\n\n\nThe magnetic moment of the \\Omega^- baryon is negative because of its negative charge, but it is 10,000 times smaller than that of the electron. The charge of the \\Omega^- is also negative, so our intuition holds that the magnetic moment should be negative. However, the mass scale in the magnetic moment formula is determined by the quark mass rather than the mass of the \\Omega^- itself. If the quark mass is roughly 500 MeV, then the mass of the \\Omega^- would be around 1500 MeV (three times the quark mass).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen calculating magnetic moments, it is simplest to work with the maximal spin projection state, as it avoids complications from mixed spin configurations.\n\n\n\nThe excitation pattern of the \\Sigma_b baryon is determined by its light diquark configuration, which in the ground state has spin S = 1 and parity 1/2^+. A bonus question concerns the isospin partners of this baryon. Since the isospin of the \\Sigma_b is I = 1, the isospin multiplet has three charge states corresponding to the projections I_z = +1, 0, -1.\nThe charges of these states are determined by their quark composition:\n\n\\Sigma_b^+ ( uu b ) has charge +1 (like a proton but with a bottom quark).\n\n\\Sigma_b^0 ( ud b ) has charge 0.\n\n\\Sigma_b^- ( dd b ) has charge -1.\n\nActing with the isospin lowering operator reduces the charge by one unit, so the pattern is straightforward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsospin symmetry is only slightly broken by quark mass differences, so the excitation patterns for all three \\Sigma_b states are nearly identical.\n\n\n\nThe excitation spectrum is determined by spin rather than isospin. Since all three isospin partners are related by symmetry, their properties—including their excited states—are very similar. The small isospin breaking due to quark mass differences is negligible for most practical purposes.\n\n\\mu \\approx \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_q c}\n\nwhere m_q is the quark mass, explains why the magnetic moment is suppressed compared to lighter particles like the electron.\nThe wave function for the \\Omega^- baryon is constructed from the spin states of the three strange quarks, with the magnetic moment operator given by:\n\n\\mu_z = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\mu_{iz}\n\nFor the highest spin projection state, the magnetic moment is straightforward to evaluate, as it depends only on the quark charges and spins. The charge of each strange quark is -1/3, so the total charge is -1.\n\n\n\n\nThe excitation pattern remains the same regardless of which state we consider as the lowest. For the diagram, we plot different quantum numbers on the x-axis, typically orbital angular momentum in the excitation spectrum, and the rest mass energy (or hadron mass) on the y-axis.\nTo construct this, we start by combining the spins of the light quarks and the heavy quark. For most hadrons (except light mesons), the radial excitation—moving from 1s to 2s orbitals—is much larger than hyperfine splitting. This is always true for heavy quarks. The energy difference from combining spins is suppressed by a factor of the heavy quark mass:\n\n\\Delta E \\sim \\frac{1}{m_Q}\n\nFor an S-wave state, combining a light diquark with spin S = 1 and a heavy quark with spin S = 1/2 yields two possible states:\n\nJ = \\frac{1}{2} \\oplus \\frac{3}{2}\n\nWhen adding one unit of orbital angular momentum (P-wave), we must consider both spin combinations separately. The multiplicity for the P-block is 5, while the S-block has a multiplicity of 2. The lowest states are \\frac{1}{2}^+ and \\frac{3}{2}^+, followed by five P-wave states. These correspond to distinct particles listed in the PDG, though some (like \\Sigma_b(300)) were discovered relatively recently.\nThe energy splitting between states arises from the heavy quark spin dynamics, while radial excitations are governed by QCD dynamics at the scale of \\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}} (a few hundred MeV). The splitting within a block is suppressed by the heavy quark mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe strong coupling diverges at \\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}}, setting the energy scale for radial excitations.\n\n\n\nFor the \\Omega^- baryon, the magnetic moment is negative due to its negative charge, though it is much smaller than the electron’s moment. The mass scale in the magnetic moment formula depends on the quark mass (m_q \\approx 500 \\ \\text{MeV}) rather than the baryon mass (\\sim 1500 \\ \\text{MeV}):\n\n\\mu \\approx \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_q c}\n\nThe \\Sigma_b baryon’s excitation pattern is determined by its light diquark (S = 1, \\frac{1}{2}^+). Its isospin partners form a triplet (I = 1) with charges:\n\n\\Sigma_b^+ (uu b): +1\n\n\\Sigma_b^0 (ud b): 0\n\n\\Sigma_b^- (dd b): -1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsospin symmetry is nearly exact here, as quark mass differences cause only minor breaking.\n\n\n\nThe magnetic moment operator for the \\Omega^- is:\n\n\\mu_z = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\mu_{iz}\n\nwhere each strange quark contributes -1/3 to the total charge.\n\n\n\n\nThe energy difference between levels arises from the dynamics of the heavy quark spin. Since the quark is heavy, all spin effects are suppressed inversely proportional to its mass. In the Lagrangian (and in all effective theories), the spin-orbit interaction appears in terms where the heavy quark mass is in the denominator.\nFor example, the mass of the b quark is around 4 \\ \\text{GeV}, which introduces an order-of-magnitude suppression. The QCD scale \\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}} is a few hundred MeV, setting the typical energy scale for these effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spin-orbit coupling in heavy quark systems is suppressed by 1/m_Q, where m_Q is the heavy quark mass.\n\n\n\nThe strong coupling diverges at \\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}}, governing the radial excitations, while spin-dependent splittings are smaller due to the heavy quark mass suppression.\n\n\n\n\nThe energy scale \\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}} is a few hundred MeV, while the typical excitation energies are on the order of a few GeV. The ratio between them is roughly 10:15, which reflects the difference between excitation energies of general quantum states and the splitting between specific levels.\nFor example, the energy difference between \\Sigma_b with spin 3/2 and \\Sigma_b with spin 1/2 is of the order of 10 MeV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe splitting between heavy quark states like \\Sigma_b is governed by spin-dependent interactions, which are suppressed by the heavy quark mass.\n\n\n\nToday’s lecture focuses on the kinematics and experimental techniques in hadron physics. This field has been extremely vibrant in the last 10 years, starting around 2004 when the first exotic particles were discovered. Since then, new observations of states that do not fit the conventional quark model (mesons and baryons) have been reported frequently.\nMany experiments worldwide now dedicate part of their programs to studying hadrons, particularly exotic ones. Large laboratories conducting particle collisions contribute to this effort. A key challenge is understanding the fundamental structure of matter—how hadrons form, which combinations are possible, and what rules determine their excitation patterns and properties.\nQuantum Chromodynamics (QCD) describes strong interactions well in regimes where computations are feasible. However, there has been no success yet in systematically classifying and predicting large multiplets of exotic hadrons. Observations are made, but relating them to theoretical predictions remains difficult due to computational limitations and the complexity of QCD dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe strong coupling diverges at \\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}}, setting the scale for radial excitations, while spin-dependent effects are smaller due to heavy quark mass suppression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe cannot do this partly because of the limitations of our computational methods. Lattice QCD, while effective for ground states, is not well-suited for computations at larger scales due to the complexity of the theory.\nThe phenomena in QCD reveal emerging behaviors that are not directly described by the Lagrangian’s quark and gluon degrees of freedom. Instead, we observe a transition in matter: from configurations where quark degrees of freedom dominate (such as quark-gluon plasma) to configurations where hadrons themselves become the relevant degrees of freedom (such as in atomic nuclei).\nIn hadron spectroscopy, this transition manifests as a boundary region where hadrons—composed of elementary quarks—coexist with larger atomic-scale objects. Here, hadrons bind into more complex structures, creating a mixed regime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transition between quark-dominated and hadron-dominated matter highlights the challenge of modeling QCD across different energy scales.\n\n\n\nThe theory’s complexity arises from the interplay of these scales, where neither perturbative methods nor pure lattice computations fully capture the dynamics. This is particularly evident in spectroscopy, where exotic states blur the line between quark-level and hadron-level descriptions.\n\n\n\n\nHadrons bind in larger objects, such as atomic nuclei, and some hadrons are complicated because their properties arise from a mixture of different configurations. Some properties require them to be compact hadrons, while others require them to be sparse hadronic molecules, which we refer to as “atoms” in hadron spectroscopy.\nCurrently, lattice QCD cannot fully address these complexities, so experiments worldwide provide new data and insights. Researchers understand these phenomena by measuring hadron properties and their decays. One approach is to observe hadrons in new decay configurations, which yield valuable information. Another is to measure the same hadron but from different production mechanisms.\nSeveral laboratories explore these mechanisms:\n\nBelle II (Japan) and BESIII (China): These experiments collide electrons and positrons, which annihilate to produce intermediate states that decay. The resulting particles are studied to understand hadron properties.\n\nLHC (CERN): Here, protons (not proton-antiproton pairs) are collided, producing a high-energy environment with many particles. Among these are long-lived particles like B and D mesons, which travel a few millimeters before decaying. Detectors track these particles, distinguishing primary and secondary vertices.\n\nAnother class of experiments uses hadronic production, where a hadron is fired at another hadron without fully describing the kinematics. These are typically fixed-target experiments, such as:\n\nGLUEX (Jefferson Lab): Uses a photon beam on a hydrogen target.\n\nCOMPASS (CERN): Uses a pion beam on a hydrogen target.\n\nIn these setups, the target particle is either excited or scatters, providing another way to study hadrons.\nThe third major approach is computing hadron properties from lattice QCD, though this method has limitations for certain states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent production mechanisms (lepton collisions, proton collisions, hadronic scattering) provide complementary insights into hadron structure and dynamics.\n\n\n\nThe interplay between these experimental methods helps clarify the transition between quark-dominated and hadron-dominated matter, a key challenge in QCD.\n\n\n\n\nThe third major way to study hadrons is to compute their properties from lattice QCD, which provides a large piece of information.\nLet’s overview the production mechanism and experiments. We start with the Beijing Spectrometer (BESIII), located at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC). This accelerator complex collides electrons and positrons. The experiment is dedicated to studying hadrons in the energy regions of charmonium and bottomonium.\nBEPC is a symmetric collider, meaning the electron and positron have the same energy. When they collide, one possible interaction is annihilation, producing a virtual photon that couples to a hadron.\nThe spin configurations in these collisions are constrained. An electron has spin 1/2, and at high energies, it has a specific helicity. When combining two spin-1/2 particles (electron and positron), the possible total spin states are 0 or 1. However, due to their nature as particle-antiparticle pairs and helicity conservation, the produced system can only have spin 1 — spin 0 is forbidden in this combination.\nAdditionally, the parity of the system is determined by the combination of the electron (1/2^-) and positron (1/2^+) in an S-wave state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spin and parity selection rules in electron-positron collisions restrict the possible hadronic states produced, providing a clean environment for studying specific quantum numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe combine particles with quantum numbers 1/2^- and 1/2^+ in an S-wave configuration. This experiment focuses on hadrons produced with quantum numbers 1^-. The data collection process involves setting the beam energy to accumulate large datasets, such as millions of events for the J/\\psi peak.\nWhen plotting the cross section as a function of energy, the distribution is not homogeneous but exhibits peaking structures. These peaks occur when the system resonates at specific frequencies, corresponding to hadronic states. By tuning the collision energy to match these resonances, the interaction probability (and thus the cross section) increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cross section magnitude indicates interaction frequency and directly influences the data volume recorded.\n\n\n\nThe J/\\psi peak is a prominent example. The German spectrum (shown here) plots orbital excitations on the X-axis and system energy on the Y-axis. The lowest state is followed by higher multiplicities, derived from quark algebra. The J/\\psi and \\eta_c belong to the same multiplet, with J/\\psi being the first discovered charmonium state.\nThe J/\\psi is a clear peak in the e^+e^- cross section spectrum, with quantum numbers 1^-. Its production is straightforward due to quantum number selection rules in relativistic collisions. The second peak in the spectrum corresponds to the excited state \\psi(2S).\nThe naming convention for J/\\psi reflects its discovery history, where “J” honors one of the lead researchers. This state is a benchmark for studying charmonium spectroscopy due to its clean experimental signature.\n\n\\sigma(E) \\propto \\text{Resonance amplitude at energy } E\n\nThe cross section enhancement at resonance energies (E_{\\text{res}}) follows the Breit-Wigner distribution:\n\n\\sigma(E) \\sim \\frac{\\Gamma^2/4}{(E - E_{\\text{res}})^2 + \\Gamma^2/4}\n\nwhere \\Gamma is the resonance width.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResonance peaks provide direct access to hadronic states with specific quantum numbers, enabling systematic studies of quarkonium spectra.\n\n\n\nThe \\psi(2S) state, as an excitation of the J/\\psi system, further probes the dynamics of heavy quark bound states.\n\n\n\n\nIn the spectrum, the excitation of this system is the \\psi(2S), which we refer to simply as “psi” here. The lowest state in the multiplet is called the J/\\psi, while the four states in the P-multiplet are labeled \\chi_{c0}, \\chi_{c1}, \\chi_{c2}, and h_c (with quantum numbers 0^+, 1^+, 2^+, and 1^+ respectively).\nFor data collection, there are two primary methods:\n\nResonance peak sitting: Accumulating data at the J/\\psi peak yields billions of events where the J/\\psi is produced and decays into various final states.\n\nEnergy scan: By tuning the beam energy over weeks, we measure the cross section at discrete points, building a profile of the resonance structure.\n\nThe total cross section is a superposition of all possible sub-processes, such as e^+e^- \\to \\text{hadrons}. Some resonances are more prominent in specific decay kinematics, so researchers often analyze a particular final state (e.g., e^+e^- \\to 3\\pi) at a selected scan point to extract hadron properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cross section enhancement follows the Breit-Wigner distribution:\n\n\n\n\n\\sigma(E) \\sim \\frac{\\Gamma^2/4}{(E - E_{\\text{res}})^2 + \\Gamma^2/4}\n\nwhere \\Gamma is the resonance width and E_{\\text{res}} is the resonance energy.\nThe J/\\psi and \\Upsilon families provide clean signatures for studying quarkonium spectroscopy due to their well-defined quantum numbers (1^-) and relativistic production mechanisms. The \\psi(2S) serves as an excited-state benchmark, probing the dynamics of heavy quark bound systems.\n\n\n\n\nThe BEL2 experiment in Japan was originally designed with the primary goal of studying CP violation, but its data proved extremely valuable for hadron spectroscopy as well. This experiment operates as an electron-positron collider and is located at KEK. It was initially called the Belle experiment, and after an upgrade 10 years ago, it became known as the SuperKEKB experiment. The predecessor was called Belle, and the upgraded version is referred to as Belle II.\nIn contrast to the Belle experiment, the colliding beams in Belle II are not symmetric. The center-of-mass energy is adjusted to a specific resonance, primarily to study B mesons and CP violation. The experiment operates at the \\Upsilon(4S) resonance, which predominantly decays into a B\\bar{B} pair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\Upsilon(4S) is a short-lived resonance that decays immediately, leaving the primary vertex and producing a B\\bar{B} pair. The physics of CP violation is then studied using these decays.\n\n\n\nA key question is why the beam energies are asymmetric. This design choice is deliberate and clever. By giving the electron and positron beams different energies, the entire system receives a boost when produced. This boost is in the direction of the higher-energy beam (the electron beam) due to energy conservation.\nThe boost has a significant effect on the B mesons:\n\nThe B mesons gain a substantial longitudinal momentum.\n\nThey live longer in the laboratory frame due to relativistic time dilation.\n\nThey travel farther from the primary vertex before decaying.\n\nThis increased flight distance is crucial for precise vertex reconstruction. By measuring the displacement between the primary vertex and the decay point (secondary vertex), we can better identify and reconstruct B meson decays. The charged tracks from these decays do not point back to the primary vertex, providing a clear signature of secondary vertices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boost effect can be quantified using relativistic kinematics. The Lorentz factor \\gamma and the velocity \\beta determine the observed lifetime \\tau_{\\text{lab}} in the lab frame:\n\n\n\n\n\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau_0, \\quad \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m}, \\quad \\beta = \\frac{p}{E}\n\nwhere \\tau_0 is the proper lifetime, E is the energy, m is the mass, and p is the momentum of the B meson.\nThis technique enhances our ability to separate signal from background and improves the precision of CP violation measurements. Before moving away from Belle II, let me connect this back to what we discussed earlier.\n\n\n\n\nLet me relate to what we just discussed earlier. Essentially, it’s the same process of e^+e^- annihilation, so we consider the total cross section \\sigma(e^+e^- \\to \\text{everything}).\nThe Belle experiment operates in the energy region of J/\\psi and \\tau production (charmonium), while the Belle II experiment focuses on the bottomonium region. Charmonium consists of c\\bar{c} states, while bottomonium is made of b\\bar{b} pairs.\nMoving to higher energies, around 10 GeV, we enter the bottomonium system, which is structurally similar to charmonium. However, since the b quark is even heavier, the hyperfine splitting is smaller. The mass difference between the \\eta_b and the vector bottomonium state ( \\Upsilon ) is reduced compared to charmonium.\nThe energy scale between levels remains roughly the same (a few hundred MeV), but within each multiplet, the states are more tightly packed. The \\Upsilon is the vector particle (spin 1^{--}) and is the bottomonium counterpart of the J/\\psi in charmonium.\n\n\n\n\nThe Upsilon (\\Upsilon) is a vector particle with spin 1^{--}, analogous to the J/\\psi in the charmonium spectrum. The J/\\psi is the easiest particle to produce in the charmonium spectrum due to its quantum numbers (1^{--}), especially in electron-positron annihilation, making it the most studied state.\nIn the bottomonium spectrum, the counterpart of the J/\\psi is the \\Upsilon. The notation 4s refers to the fourth excited state in the bottomonium spectrum, arising from the 4 \\times acceleration of the spectrum. When scanning the energy, the states appear sequentially: first the \\Upsilon(1s), then \\Upsilon(2s), \\Upsilon(3s), and finally \\Upsilon(4s).\nAll these states lie above the threshold for B-meson production, with masses exceeding 9 GeV. For example, the \\Upsilon(1s) has a mass around 9.46 GeV, while higher states like \\Upsilon(4s) are even heavier.\nProton-proton collisions are significantly more complex than electron-positron annihilations. The multiplicity of particles produced in such collisions is very high, increasing with energy. At the LHC, with proton beams at 7.7 TeV, the collisions are symmetric. However, since these are not annihilation processes, the produced particles are typically boosted due to the initial quark and gluon interactions.\nThe typical multiplicity of particles produced in a single proton-proton collision is on the order of thousands. The transverse momentum (p_T) spectrum follows an exponential distribution, with most particles at low momentum and a tail extending to higher energies. The typical energy scale for particles in these collisions is hundreds of GeV, though individual particle energies can range from tens to hundreds of GeV.\n\n\\frac{dN}{dp_T} \\sim e^{-p_T / T}\n\nHere, T represents the characteristic temperature of the system, describing the slope of the momentum distribution. Even when the total collision energy is shared among thousands of particles, the typical energy per particle remains in the range of a few GeV, with many low-momentum particles dominating the spectrum.\n\n\n\n\nThe typical energy scale for light, low-momentum particles is a few hundred GeV. The LHC has been highly productive in discovering new particles, particularly due to its high cross-section. The cross-section for electron-positron annihilation is much smaller than for proton-proton interactions, enabling the study of hadron production.\nThere are two main production mechanisms in collider processes:\n\nPrompt production: The particle of interest originates directly from the primary vertex.\n\nCascade production: The particle decays weakly, producing a secondary vertex.\n\nFor example, the observation of the \\Omega_c baryon and the $_c^{(*)} $ states in prompt production has significantly impacted hadron spectroscopy. The cascade (\\Xi) particle, the ground state of the cascade multiplet, decays weakly since the charm or bottom quark is stable under strong interactions.\nThe lifetime of such weakly decaying particles is around 10^{-10} seconds. If the particle is boosted to 100 GeV, it travels millimeters before decaying, allowing separation from the primary vertex. Ground states of charm or bottom hadrons typically displace by 5–6 millimeters.\nTo reconstruct the secondary vertex, charged particles (e.g., proton-kaon pairs) are combined from the thousands of produced particles. By looping over all kaon-proton (K\\pi) pairs and matching them with identified cascade decays, resonances produced at the primary vertex can be isolated. The mass spectrum of the \\Xi_c K system reveals clear peaks corresponding to these resonances.\n\n\\frac{dN}{dp_T} \\sim e^{-p_T / T}\n\nHere, T represents the characteristic temperature of the system, describing the exponential slope of the transverse momentum (p_T) distribution. Most particles have low momentum, with a tail extending to higher energies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak decays of heavy-flavor hadrons (e.g., \\Xi_c) produce measurable secondary vertices, crucial for distinguishing them from prompt backgrounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVertex resolution at the LHC is sufficient to resolve displacements as small as a few millimeters, enabling precise reconstruction of cascade decays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the spectrum of the cascade \\Xi_c mass, you observe five distinct bumps. These correspond to the highest probability of producing a system, indicating resonant behavior at frequencies matching the excited states in the \\Omega_c model.\nThe \\Omega_c baryon is identified by counting strangeness: it contains two strange quarks ( s ) and one charm quark ( c ), denoted as ssc. In contrast, the cascade ( \\Xi_c ) is suc, and the kaon-nucleon ( KN ) system is s\\bar{u}.\nAnother approach involves studying secondary vertices from B decays. Ground-state hadrons with a b quark include B mesons and \\Lambda_b baryons. These are most easily produced via currents carrying the b quark. As ground states, they decay rapidly, with lifetimes on the order of 10^{-9} seconds. However, when boosted, they produce secondary vertices several centimeters away from the primary interaction point.\nFor example, a displacement of two centimeters is observable in detectors, such as those at CERN. This flight distance separates the primary interaction vertex from the decay products, enabling clean kinematic reconstruction. By measuring the momentum of the B hadron and the decay length, you isolate its decay and study resonances within it.\nA prominent example is the decay \\Lambda_b \\to J/\\psi \\, p \\, K^-. This three-body decay allows analysis of exclusive final-state combinations ( J/\\psi \\, p \\, K^- ). The spectrum of the pK^- system shows bumps corresponding to \\Lambda resonances, while the J/\\psi \\, p spectrum reveals unexpected peaks. These peaks are attributed to pentaquark ( P_c ) resonances, specifically u u g c \\bar{c} combinations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\Omega_c and \\Xi_c resonances are key to understanding the spectrum of charm-strange baryons, with their production and decay patterns offering insights into QCD dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary vertex analysis is crucial for isolating weakly decaying heavy-flavor hadrons, as their displaced decays reduce background contamination from prompt production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe u u g c \\bar{c} combinations represent a resonance. Let’s briefly review fixed target experiments and their techniques, with three examples:\n\nGLUEX at Jefferson Lab: Uses a 9 GeV photon beam directed at a liquid hydrogen target, which provides protons as the interaction medium.\n\nCompass at CERN: Operates with a pion beam and also employs a liquid hydrogen target.\n\nCB-ELSA (corrected from “CD alpha tops”): Utilizes a photon beam at 2 GeV, focusing on light hadron spectroscopy rather than charm or bottom production.\n\nMost of these experiments study light hadrons, including pions and kaons. The GlueX experiment, in particular, investigates the same physics domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed target experiments like GlueX and Compass are optimized for precision measurements of light hadron spectra, leveraging controlled beam-target interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiquid hydrogen targets are commonly used due to their purity and simplicity in providing proton targets for beam interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GlueX experiment is doing the same physics but with a different setup, beam type, and energy. CPL setups in Bonn are starting with rns, and it begins in the office.\nIt is important to realize that there are two different mechanisms involved in fixed-target experiments at intermediate energies. These are not TVs. The first process is diffraction, and the second is S-channel scattering. The process that occurs when two particles collide depends on the energy.\nIn diffraction, the proton acts as a source of the strong interaction field. Here, the proton emits gluons, serving as a source of gluonic fields. A pion or photon then interacts with these gluonic fields and becomes excited. The excited state (X) propagates briefly before decaying.\n\n\n\n\nThe excited state “flies” for a brief moment before decaying, though in reality, it doesn’t physically move far due to the strong interaction timescales. Hadronic resonances, particularly light ones in detectors, exist for times on the order of 10^{-25} seconds, which is insufficient to displace them measurably from the primary vertex. However, we still represent them as separate particles in diagrams for clarity.\nIf the system’s energy is too high, resonances cannot form — there are no frequencies for the system to “resonate” at. The process becomes more plausible at lower energies, where a proton and an incoming beam (pion or photon) can resonate at specific frequencies. For instance, at energies around 2–3 GeV, this resonant interaction occurs.\nIn fixed-target kinematics, experiments like COMPASS study the diffractive regime, while CERN’s CPL focuses on S-channel production. These experiments probe baryonic excitations by analyzing resonance decays. The GlueX experiment at Jefferson Lab operates at 9 GeV, an intermediate energy where both diffractive and S-channel processes coexist, leading to coherent interference. Ideally, higher energies would isolate one process over the other, but at these scales, all possible interactions occur and must be accounted for.\n\n\n\n\nIn particle interactions, all possible kinematic configurations occur, and we must account for them. The setups and kinematics involve many intricate and interesting aspects that may be explored in future lectures.\nRegarding experiments, some are currently operational, while others are planned for the future. For example, the GlueX experiment is still running but is in its final years. There are proposals to upgrade it to “GlueX2” or a similar configuration, which would focus more on spectroscopy.\nA key question arises about the interaction mechanism in diagrams: is it direct or indirect gluon exchange? The answer lies in the color-neutral nature of the proton. Since a single gluon cannot maintain color neutrality, the proton emits a gluonic field instead. This field is color-neutral, and we describe the process as diffraction rather than simple gluon exchange.\nThe physical interpretation is as follows: the proton acts as a stationary source, emitting this gluonic field. The interaction resembles light scattering off an object, producing a diffractive pattern. The proton behaves like a “black disk,” and the resulting diffraction is observed. The exchanged entity — a collective state of gluon fields — is called the Pomeron.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pomeron is not a true particle and does not appear in the Particle Data Group (PDG) listings. It is a phenomenological construct used to describe the behavior of the gluon field in diffractive processes.\n\n\n\nThis process is not fully understood in terms of individual gluons but is well-established phenomenologically. The Pomeron represents the effective description of the gluon field’s role in diffraction.\n\n\n\n\nThe sum of momenta in an exclusive scattering process is given by:\n\n\\sum_i (\\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 + \\vec{p}_3 + ... - \\vec{p}_A - \\vec{p}_B) = \\sum_i \\sum_p \\sum_p \\sum_A\n\nThis represents the momentum balance between initial and final states.\nExclusive reactions are those where all particles are measured and accounted for, such as 1 \\to n or 2 \\to n processes. In contrast, inclusive processes involve unmeasured particles produced alongside the system of interest.\nTo count the kinematic variables describing such a process, we consider the four-momenta of all particles involved. Each particle has four components in its four-vector, but one constraint (mass-shell condition) reduces this to three independent components. For a 2 \\to 3 process, we have 5 particles (2 initial + 3 final), each contributing 3 independent momentum components, totaling 15 variables.\nWe then subtract the constraints from energy-momentum conservation, which imposes four delta functions (one for energy and three for momentum):\n\n\\delta^4 \\left( \\sum_{\\text{final}} p_i - \\sum_{\\text{initial}} p_j \\right)\n\nThis reduces the number of independent variables to 15 - 4 = 11 for a 2 \\to 3 process.\nThe interaction in such processes is often represented diagrammatically, where a “blob” denotes the interaction and lines represent incoming or outgoing particles. The Pomeron, a phenomenological construct, describes the collective gluon field in diffractive interactions, though it is not a true particle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pomeron is color-neutral and represents the effective description of the gluon field’s role in diffraction, rather than a single gluon exchange.\n\n\n\nThis approach is well-established phenomenologically, even if the underlying gluon dynamics are not fully understood.\n\n\n\n\nFor a 2 \\to 3 process, we start with 15 variables (5 particles × 3 independent momentum components each). After accounting for energy-momentum conservation, we reduce this to 15 - 4 = 11 variables needed to describe the kinematics in any frame.\nWe can further reduce these degrees of freedom by choosing a specific frame. Fixing the frame eliminates 6 degrees of freedom: 3 for rotations and 3 for boosts.\nThe momentum balance is given by:\n\n\\sum_i (\\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 + \\vec{p}_3 + ... - \\vec{p}_A - \\vec{p}_B) = \\sum_i \\sum_p \\sum_p \\sum_A\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m going to lose six degrees of freedom: three for rotation and three for boosts. This gives the number of variables in this type of matrix.\nThe boost annotations are important to realize. The analogy is that you can think of the reaction block as a solid rigid bow with arrows sticking out. You can hold it in your hand, and this is essentially a rigid body.\nFor rigid bodies, there are three Euler rotations that describe the orientation of the body. These are exactly the three rotations you need to fix. You can think of it this way: for every event, for every set of kinematic variables, you can identify the length of the vectors and their mutual orientation.\nFor every set of kinematic variables, you could take a 3D printer and print it. These three rotations would then determine its orientation. In computations, these rotations are crucial for fixing the frame.\n\n\n\n\nIn computations, we often need the quantity that’s essential for calculating cross sections: the number of configurations the system can take. These configurations include not only the overall system’s orientation (three rotations and three boosts) but also the mutual orientations of the components.\nThe Lorentz-invariant phase space element counts the number of configurations for every particle in the final state. For each particle, the phase space element is:\n\nd\\rho = \\frac{d^4 p}{(2\\pi)^4} \\delta(p^2 - m^2)\n\nHere, d^4 p is the four-momentum volume element, and the delta function enforces the mass-shell condition. By integrating over the energy component, we obtain the familiar form:\n\n\\frac{d^3 p}{2E (2\\pi)^3}\n\nThe delta function ensures energy-momentum conservation, and we sum over all zeros of the delta function. To exclude negative-energy solutions, we include a theta function for energy:\n\n\\delta(p^2 - m^2) \\rightarrow \\delta(E^2 - \\vec{p}^2 - m^2) \\theta(E)\n\nEach delta function comes with a factor of 2\\pi, which is straightforward to remember. The energy-momentum conservation constraint is implemented via:\n\n(2\\pi)^4 \\delta^4 \\left( \\sum_i p_i - P_{\\text{tot}} \\right)\n\nThis ensures the total four-momentum is conserved in the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phase space element accounts for all possible kinematic configurations while respecting Lorentz invariance and energy-momentum conservation.\n\n\n\nThe rigid body analogy helps visualize this: for every set of kinematic variables, the system’s orientation is fixed by three Euler rotations, analogous to holding a rigid body in space. These rotations are crucial for defining the reference frame in computations.\n\n\n\n\nThe recursive evaluation of phase space is a straightforward concept, particularly when considering multi-particle systems. Here, we examine the case of a 4-body process. While the mathematical exercise of simplifying the integral is possible, it is not necessary to demonstrate explicitly that this complex integral reduces to a product of two-body phase spaces.\nThe diagram in question does not represent the dynamics of the process but rather operates with kinematic variables. The transition from 1 to 4 particles introduces additional degrees of freedom—specifically, 15 variables. When calculating phase space, we account for 3 integrals per particle, hence the factor of 3 in the phase space formula for each particle.\nThe initial state does not contribute to the phase space count; only the final state is considered. The four energy-momentum conservation laws are explicitly enforced, reducing the number of remaining integrals. Starting with 12 integrals (3 per particle for 4 particles), we subtract 4 for momentum conservation, leaving 8.\nThe remaining kinematic degrees of freedom include 5 variables for overall rotation (3 of which are finite Euler angles) and 3 boosts. The choice of these 5 variables is arbitrary and depends on the most convenient parameterization for calculating dynamics. The recursive approach does not prescribe specific interactions or reaction pathways—it is purely a kinematic parameterization.\nA common choice is to introduce intermediate mass variables, such as x and y, and express the phase space as:\n\nd\\rho = \\int \\frac{dM_x^2}{2\\pi} \\frac{dM_y^2}{2\\pi} \\cdot d\\rho_2(0 \\to y + 3)\n\nThis recursive expression is not limited to 2-body processes but can also be extended to 3-body cases. The key feature is the introduction of intermediate mass variables, over which we integrate. Each such integral includes a factor of 2\\pi in the numerator.\nThe Lorentz-invariant phase space element for each particle is given by:\n\nd\\rho = \\frac{d^3 p_i}{2E_i (2\\pi)^3}\n\nand the overall conservation is enforced by:\n\n(2\\pi)^4 \\delta^4 \\left( \\sum_i \\vec{p}_i - \\vec{P}_{\\text{tot}} \\right)\n\nThis recursive decomposition simplifies the computation of multi-particle phase space while maintaining Lorentz invariance and energy-momentum conservation. The choice of kinematic variables remains flexible, tailored to the specific problem at hand.\n\n\n\n\nEvery integral in phase space comes with a 2\\pi in the numerator. For example, introducing an intermediate state Y in the process 0 \\to Y + 4 and then Y \\to 1 + 2 + 3 is a valid decomposition. Once you learn this trick, phase space calculations become straightforward because every 2-body phase space has the form:\n\nd\\rho_2 = \\frac{2p}{\\sqrt{s}} \\cdot \\frac{\\Omega}{4\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\n\nThis expression does not simplify further and represents a general feature of the 2-body phase space. We had an opportunity to derive this in class, but we did not complete it.\nThe Lorentz-invariant phase space for a single particle is given by:\n\nd\\rho = \\frac{d^3 p_i}{2E_i (2\\pi)^3}\n\nand the overall energy-momentum conservation is enforced by:\n\n(2\\pi)^4 \\delta^4 \\left( \\sum_i \\vec{p}_i - \\vec{P}_{\\text{tot}} \\right)\n\nThe recursive approach allows breaking down multi-particle phase space into simpler 2-body components, making calculations more manageable.\n\n\n\n\nWith the formula we derived, you can now calculate any n-body phase space. There is an exercise to explore the three-body phase space, which has 3 \\times 3 - 4 = 5 degrees of freedom, minus 3 for rotations, leaving only 2 variables. The distribution is often represented using these two variables, typically chosen as invariant masses. This representation is called the Dalitz plot.\nThe Lorentz-invariant phase space for a single particle is:\n\nd\\rho = \\frac{d^3 p_i}{2E_i (2\\pi)^3}\n\nand overall energy-momentum conservation is enforced by:\n\n(2\\pi)^4 \\delta^4 \\left( \\sum_i \\vec{p}_i - \\vec{P}_{\\text{tot}} \\right)\n\nThe recursive approach simplifies multi-particle phase space calculations by breaking them into 2-body components.\n\n\n\n\nThe representation is called Dalitz plot. Hope to get the book next time. Let’s have a round of questions for a minute. I won’t have an exercise tonight. Any questions? Have you seen this before? That’s really good, because these computations are not complicated, but they give you a lot of insight into how things work. Thanks for coming today, and don’t forget to leave feedback sheets.\nThis week we will not have exercises. Next week, would Wednesday or Friday work for you?"

The total wave function is a product of color, isospin, spin, and flavor components, but color and isospin are factored out, leaving only flavor and spin. The flavor part is trivial, so we focus on spin.\nThe spin configuration must yield a total spin of 3/2 for the \\Omega^- baryon, with parity +. This implies orbital angular momentum L = 1, and the spin must be 1/2 to achieve the correct total angular momentum J = 3/2.\nFor question 2, the 1s multiplet excitation of \\Sigma_p involves understanding the spin structure of the system, particularly how the spin states align to form the lowest-energy configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\Omega^- baryon’s magnetic moment arises from the contributions of its three strange quarks, each with spin 1/2.

Large laboratories conducting particle collisions contribute to this effort. A key challenge is understanding the fundamental structure of matter—how hadrons form, which combinations are possible, and what rules determine their excitation patterns and properties.\nQuantum Chromodynamics (QCD) describes strong interactions well in regimes where computations are feasible. However, there has been no success yet in systematically classifying and predicting large multiplets of exotic hadrons.

Instead, we observe a transition in matter: from configurations where quark degrees of freedom dominate (such as quark-gluon plasma) to configurations where hadrons themselves become the relevant degrees of freedom (such as in atomic nuclei).\nIn hadron spectroscopy, this transition manifests as a boundary region where hadrons—composed of elementary quarks—coexist with larger atomic-scale objects.

This experiment operates as an electron-positron collider and is located at KEK. It was initially called the Belle experiment, and after an upgrade 10 years ago, it became known as the SuperKEKB experiment. The predecessor was called Belle, and the upgraded version is referred to as Belle II.\nIn contrast to the Belle experiment, the colliding beams in Belle II are not symmetric. The center-of-mass energy is adjusted to a specific resonance, primarily to study B mesons and CP violation. The experiment operates at the \\Upsilon(4S) resonance, which predominantly decays into a B\\bar{B} pair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\Upsilon(4S) is a short-lived resonance that decays immediately, leaving the primary vertex and producing a B\\bar{B} pair. The physics of CP violation is then studied using these decays.\n\n\n\nA key question is why the beam energies are asymmetric. This design choice is deliberate and clever. By giving the electron and positron beams different energies, the entire system receives a boost when produced. This boost is in the direction of the higher-energy beam (the electron beam) due to energy conservation.\nThe boost has a significant effect on the B mesons:\n\nThe B mesons gain a substantial longitudinal momentum.\n\nThey live longer in the laboratory frame due to relativistic time dilation.\n\nThey travel farther from the primary vertex before decaying.\n\nThis increased flight distance is crucial for precise vertex reconstruction. By measuring the displacement between the primary vertex and the decay point (secondary vertex), we can better identify and reconstruct B meson decays. The charged tracks from these decays do not point back to the primary vertex, providing a clear signature of secondary vertices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boost effect can be quantified using relativistic kinematics.

This field is color-neutral, and we describe the process as diffraction rather than simple gluon exchange.\nThe physical interpretation is as follows: the proton acts as a stationary source, emitting this gluonic field.

For a 2 \\to 3 process, we have 5 particles (2 initial + 3 final), each contributing 3 independent momentum components, totaling 15 variables.\nWe then subtract the constraints from energy-momentum conservation, which imposes four delta functions (one for energy and three for momentum):\n\n\\delta^4 \\left( \\sum_{\\text{final}} p_i - \\sum_{\\text{initial}} p_j \\right)\n\nThis reduces the number of independent variables to 15 - 4 = 11 for a 2 \\to 3 process.\nThe interaction in such processes is often represented diagrammatically, where a “blob” denotes the interaction and lines represent incoming or outgoing particles. The Pomeron, a phenomenological construct, describes the collective gluon field in diffractive interactions, though it is not a true particle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pomeron is color-neutral and represents the effective description of the gluon field’s role in diffraction, rather than a single gluon exchange.\n\n\n\nThis approach is well-established phenomenologically, even if the underlying gluon dynamics are not fully understood."

    "text": "The recursive evaluation of phase space is a straightforward concept, particularly when considering multi-particle systems. Here, we examine the case of a 4-body process. While the mathematical exercise of simplifying the integral is possible, it is not necessary to demonstrate explicitly that this complex integral reduces to a product of two-body phase spaces.\nThe diagram in question does not represent the dynamics of the process but rather operates with kinematic variables. The transition from 1 to 4 particles introduces additional degrees of freedom—specifically, 15 variables. When calculating phase space, we account for 3 integrals per particle, hence the factor of 3 in the phase space formula for each particle.\nThe initial state does not contribute to the phase space count; only the final state is considered. The four energy-momentum conservation laws are explicitly enforced, reducing the number of remaining integrals. Starting with 12 integrals (3 per particle for 4 particles), we subtract 4 for momentum conservation, leaving 8.\nThe remaining kinematic degrees of freedom include 5 variables for overall rotation (3 of which are finite Euler angles) and 3 boosts. The choice of these 5 variables is arbitrary and depends on the most convenient parameterization for calculating dynamics. The recursive approach does not prescribe specific interactions or reaction pathways—it is purely a kinematic parameterization.\nA common choice is to introduce intermediate mass variables, such as x and y, and express the phase space as:\n\nd\\rho = \\int \\frac{dM_x^2}{2\\pi} \\frac{dM_y^2}{2\\pi} \\cdot d\\rho_2(0 \\to y + 3)\n\nThis recursive expression is not limited to 2-body processes but can also be extended to 3-body cases.

    "text": "0.1 Kinematics and Variables in Two-Particle Scattering Processes\nToday we are at lecture number five. We’ll discuss angle distributions and partial wave analysis. But before going there, I would like to start with a recap.\n\nLast lecture, we discussed:\n\nThe phase space for particle reactions\nDifferent experiments in their kinematics\nA list of experiments worldwide studying hadrons, their production mechanisms, and peculiarities\n\nLet’s begin with a recap on kinematics.\n\nFirst question: How many variables does one need to describe a two-body scattering process?\nWe have two examples:\n\nScalar particles: 0^- scalars scattering to 0^- scalars in the final state.\nParticles with spin: P^+ scattering from 0^- to 3^- and 1^+.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scattering process is represented by a “blob” diagram, indicating interaction via strong interaction theory. This is a unitarity diagram (not a Feynman diagram), useful for visualization.\n\n\n\n\nThe internal dynamics (electromagnetic, strong, gravity, etc.) do not affect the number of variables.\n\nStart with 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 12 degrees of freedom (4 particles, 3 momentum components each).\nSubtract 4 for energy-momentum conservation.\nSubtract 6 (3 rotations, 3 boosts) since the system has no preferred frame.\nResult: 2 variables.\nThe answer is also 2.\nAngular distributions of final-state particles do not introduce additional independent variables.\n\n\n\nFor scalar particles, the amplitude is a function of s and t: \ns = (p_1 + p_2)^2, \\quad t = (p_1 - p_3)^2.\n Here, s is the center-of-mass energy squared, and t is the momentum transfer squared.\nFor particles with spin, the amplitude is higher-dimensional. Example for 3^- and 1^+ final state: \n\\text{dim}(\\mathcal{A}) = (2 \\times 3 + 1)(2 \\times 1 + 1) = 7 \\times 3 = 21.\n All 21 amplitudes depend on the same two variables, s and t.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf final-state particles decay, additional variables may be introduced. But for now, we restrict ourselves to two variables.\n\n\n\n\nFor part C, the two variables to describe the process are:\n\nMandelstam variables s and t (most common choice).\nThese are Lorentz invariants—they characterize the process independently of the frame.\n\nThe mass of a particle is given by: \nm^2 = E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 = p_\\mu p^\\mu.\n\n\nBy the way, I recently learned that “invariance” might not be a word in the dictionary. But it sounds natural to me—I use it all the time to mean “invariant variables.”\n\n\n0.2 Variables and Kinematics in Three-Body Decay and the Dalitz Plot\nLet’s give examples of these sets of variables. We’ve got one from Hendrik. Everyone should choose their favorite. Ilya, what’s your favorite? S and T. No, not a single pair—these are sets. We need two variables to describe the process. What are your favorite two variables? Oh, this is it.\nWhat’s your second favorite? Or the third variable? Why a third? Just introduce something new. Let’s introduce another. Sven, what about you? P_2 - P_4. It’s called U, and it’s also a variable P. Wait, P_2 - P_4 is the same as P_1 - P_3. So P_1 - P_4 squared is called U.\nIf you do the algebra, you’ll find there are only two independent variables. Your favorite set is S and U, and they’re equivalent because U is a linear combination of S and T. Some prefer T and U.\nAlternatively, we can use the center-of-mass energy and the angle. That’s a great choice—probably my favorite. The center-of-mass energy is \\sqrt{s}, and the angle is defined in the center-of-mass frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMandelstam Variables:\n\ns = (p_1 + p_2)^2 (center-of-mass energy squared)\nt = (p_1 - p_3)^2 (momentum transfer squared)\nu = (p_1 - p_4)^2 (related by s + t + u = \\sum m_i^2)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame (also called the center-of-momentum frame), the momenta sum to zero. You have P_1 and P_3. The angle between P_1 and P_3 defines the kinematics. Be careful when drawing this—the lengths of the vectors represent their momenta. In the final state, the momenta must still balance in the same frame.\nAny two independent variables work. For example, E_1 and E_3 in the lab frame are also fine. But you must ensure the variables aren’t redundant. Sometimes, the phase space folds when mapped to certain variables, making the transformation non-bijective.\n\nNow, let’s discuss the homework on the Dalitz plot. This marks the shift to topics specific to hadron spectroscopy. One key subject is particle representation, particularly three-body decays. The Dalitz plot is a powerful tool to visualize interaction dynamics.\nFor a three-body decay, the diagram has one incoming leg and three outgoing legs, with the blob representing the interaction. The number of kinematic variables is the same as before—two variables fully describe the process. Give me S and T, or angles, and I can reconstruct the entire kinematics.\nThink of the rigid body analogy: a 3D-printed blob with fixed-length vectors sticking out. The angles and lengths define the kinematics. For a three-body decay, I draw three vectors. The Dalitz plot variables S and T are defined similarly, but now for different final-state particles.\nFor a three-body decay, we define:\n\ns = (p_3 + p_4)^2\nt = (p_1 - p_3)^2\n\nThe phase space for three-body decays is flat in these variables. The differential width \\frac{d\\Gamma}{dm_{34}^2 dm_{24}^2} is constant.\n\nThe recursive formula for phase space gives:\n\nd\\Phi_3 = d\\Phi_2(m_{12}^2) \\cdot d\\Phi_2(m_{23}^2) \\cdot \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^2} dm_{12}^2 dm_{23}^2\n\nEach two-body phase space contributes:\n\nd\\Phi_2 = \\frac{1}{8\\pi} \\frac{2|\\mathbf{p}|}{\\sqrt{s}} \\frac{d\\Omega}{4\\pi}\n\nThe Jacobian for transforming to Mandelstam variables is constant, so the density in (m_{34}^2, m_{24}^2) is undistorted. This makes Mandelstam variables ideal for studying interactions directly.\nWe’ll revisit this in exercises, but the key takeaway is that three-body phase space is uniform in these variables, revealing the underlying dynamics clearly.\n\n\n0.3 Λc Baryon Decay Dynamics and Dalitz Plot Analysis\nYou can see the example of the \\Lambda_c baryon decay: \\Lambda_c \\to p K^- \\pi^+. We measure \\Lambda_c produced in proton-proton collisions or other interactions. In the BES and Belle experiments, they observe \\Lambda_c. This is one of those particles that lives long and is produced abundantly.\n\nParticles with charm ground states are produced abundantly and live long enough to fly from the primary vertex. We reconstruct them, which is why we have a good sample and understanding of their decay kinematics—and dynamics as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reconstruction relies on the invariant mass formula: \nm_{ij}^2 = (p_i + p_j)^2 = (E_i + E_j)^2 - (\\vec{p}_i + \\vec{p}_j)^2\n where m_{ij} is the invariant mass of particles i and j.\n\n\n\n\nIn this decay, there is a charm quark in the initial state but none in the final state, indicating weak interaction. The charm quark decays, transitioning into a strange quark that ends up in the kaon: c \\to s. This is a transition within one generation, so it is not suppressed—it’s an allowed process.\n\nThis is the golden channel for detection because the final state has three charged particles: - The proton is charged, travels well, and is stable. - The kaon is stable in our accelerator experiments. - The pion is also stable.\nThey fly directly from the decay without distraction, leaving clear tracks in the detectors. We see they point away from the primary interaction, with a ~10 mm shift in \\Lambda_c energies between the primary and secondary vertices. This ~1 cm displacement is due to the boost, as \\Lambda_c in the lab frame lives longer than in its rest frame. It is produced with a few hundred GeV in proton-proton collisions at the LHC.\n\nThis is a very clean decay, and we’ve studied it extensively. Here is the result of the analysis, which closely resembles experimental data. The statistics are so high that the distribution appears smooth.\nOn the x-axis is the invariant mass m_{pK^-}, and on the y-axis is m_{K^-\\pi^+}. The colored region shows all kinematically allowed values for the decay. The white area represents forbidden kinematics where energy and momentum cannot be conserved.\n\nIf you select a point inside the plot, you can compute the angles between particles and reconstruct the 3D setup. But for points in the white region, no configuration satisfies the constraints. This limited range of invariant masses defines the Dalitz plot.\nDifferent colors on the plot indicate varying probabilities for the decay to occur at specific kinematics. We measure the decay, reconstruct the particle tracks, and map them to kinematic points—since there’s a unique relation between four-momenta and kinematics.\n\nIt turns out certain kinematics are more probable than others. Particles prefer specific directions—for example, one alignment might be more likely than another. You can see this preference as variations in the plot’s density.\nHere’s a hint: particles aligned in a straight line lie on the plot’s boundary. Inside the boundary, they always have an angle between them. Think about how to maximize the invariant mass and where this point lies on the border.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalitz plot boundary condition is given by: \n(m_{pK^-} + m_{\\pi^+})^2 \\leq m_{\\Lambda_c}^2\n This defines the kinematic limits of the decay.\n\n\n\n\n\n0.4 Maximizing and Minimizing Mass in Three-Body Decay Kinematics\nAny thoughts? I think you should be in the bottom right because we want to maximize the mass of pK. There are three momenta going out. My idea was that the three momenta are in opposite directions, so the three-momentum of the system should be as small as possible.\nThe three-momentum of the system? Yes. If we add both momentum vectors, the forward momentum—the sum of the squares—should be as large as possible. So we should be on the right of our diagram. If we add them and they are in the same direction, we should be at the lowest point.\nYou argue that this mass on the y-axis should be as small as possible. Why? Because the three-momenta are aligned, and we subtract them.\n\nHere’s another way to think about it: if you go to their rest frame and boost, the K and \\pi fly next to each other. Their relative momentum is small. If you boost to their rest frame, they might both be at rest. Therefore, their mass would just be the sum of their masses. So it’s the maximum or minimum?\nYou are correct. We are looking for the minimal mass of the K\\pi system. Let’s figure out what this point corresponds to. This is the kinematics where the two particles have maximal momentum and are at rest, then go in opposite directions. That corresponds to this point.\n\nThis plot is from experimental data, right? Yes. But in the experiment, we won’t detect the proton directly. This is the lab frame, not the center-of-momentum frame. Everything we measure is boosted. Even if the proton is at rest in the lab frame, it’s already boosted.\nThis point is the maximum mass. The particles have maximum momentum and go back-to-back, so this is the maximum mass. The other point minimizes the mass.\n\nFor the three-body decay, there’s a similar approach. The standard way to define the angle is to boost into the frame of interest. Let me show you the setup—apologies for using proton, K, and \\pi.\nI want to fix the mass of the K\\pi system and explore how it changes by varying the mass of the proton. To do this, take the setup in the center-of-momentum frame and boost to the K\\pi rest frame. In the center-of-momentum frame, the three particles are emitted such that the sum of their three-momenta is zero.\nOnce I boost, the \\Lambda_c has non-zero momentum, and the K and \\pi have momenta that add to zero since we’re in their rest frame. If I fix the mass of the K\\pi system and explore phase space along this line, the lengths of the momentum vectors are fixed. Only the angle \\theta changes.\nAt this point, I have a specific \\theta. I can explore all angles from 0 to \\pi. At one extreme, the angle is 0; at the other, it’s \\pi.\n\nLet’s reflect a bit more. Which coordinate corresponds to which? The right should be 0, and the left \\pi.\nIn this setup, the proton and K go in opposite directions, giving the maximum mass of pK. For our new setup, since the lengths of all vectors are fixed, we can only rotate them. The mass of two particles depends on the angle \\theta: the wider the angle, the larger the mass.\nFor \\theta = 0, the mass is very high. When the particles go in almost the same direction, the mass is small.\n\nI can do the same with the other pair. Let me fix the mass of the proton and K system. The most straightforward way to analyze this is to go to the rest frame of pK, where everything is fixed, and scan along this line by changing the angle of the \\pi with respect to the rest.\nThere’s a third variable in 2-to-2 scattering called u, which is even more symmetric. For three particles, there’s the mass of \\pi p. It’s not immediately obvious what this mass is, but if I fix the mass of the K\\pi system and scan the angle, the line I move along is easy to understand from the relation:\n\nu = m_{p\\pi}^2 = (E_p + E_\\pi)^2 - (\\vec{p}_p + \\vec{p}_\\pi)^2\n\nThe u variable is a linear combination of the other two. It’s actually a diagonal in this plot. This line corresponds to the mass of \\pi p being fixed, and I move from one corner to another by changing the angle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Formulas for Dalitz Plots The invariant mass for a particle system is given by: \nM^2 = \\left(\\sum_i E_i\\right)^2 - \\left(\\sum_i \\vec{p}_i\\right)^2\n For \\Lambda_c \\to pK\\pi decay, the Dalitz plot variables are: \nm_{pK}^2 = (E_p + E_K)^2 - (\\vec{p}_p + \\vec{p}_K)^2\n \nm_{K\\pi}^2 = (E_K + E_\\pi)^2 - (\\vec{p}_K + \\vec{p}_\\pi)^2\n The symmetric representation uses: \nx = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(m_{K\\pi}^2 - m_{p\\pi}^2)\n \ny = m_{pK}^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(m_{K\\pi}^2 + m_{p\\pi}^2)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard representation in experimental analysis for a Dalitz plot has the mass of one pair on the x-axis and the mass of another pair on the y-axis. But there’s also a more symmetric Dalitz plot where all variables enter symmetrically.\nThis uses the properties of an equilateral triangle: for any point inside, the sum of the distances to the sides is constant. This allows us to introduce variables where the masses are the distances to the sides.\nThe variables are:\n\nx = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(m_{K\\pi}^2 - m_{p\\pi}^2)\n \ny = m_{pK}^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(m_{K\\pi}^2 + m_{p\\pi}^2)\n\nThis is a symmetric, nice representation. It’s the same as the standard plot but skewed. To relate Cartesian coordinates to the heights of the triangle, you need a transformation involving \\sqrt{3}/2 due to the 60-degree angles.\nThis symmetric representation is elegant, but the standard plot is more common and easier to use. Both represent the kinematics, and we see points where the density increases.\n\nThe goal of this kinematic representation is to understand the dynamics and the processes driving the interaction. Looking ahead, we’ll see that this decay isn’t just \\Lambda_c \\to p K \\pi, but proceeds via intermediate resonances.\nFor a short time, two particles form an intermediate state that then dissociates, increasing the decay probability. If the energy is in a certain range, these particles interact more strongly, and the probability of the process increases.\n\n\n0.5 Exploring Hadronic Resonances and Dalitz Plot Structures in Two-Particle Systems\nYou might have seen cross sections for two-particle resonances. These show a bump known as the hadronic resonance. The physics behind this is that you have a system of two particles whose quantum numbers match those of some resonance.\nBy adjusting the energy of the system, you explore how the system behaves and how likely the two particles are to interact at a given energy. If there is an intermediate resonance, the system can resonate at this energy, and the interaction probability increases as you pass through the resonance region.\nThis leads to the appearance of bent structures in the Dalitz plot distribution. If you project it onto one of the axes, you’ll see a resonance-like shape. These bent structures can be identified in both representations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Breit-Wigner formula describes the resonance cross-section: \n\\sigma(E) = \\frac{4\\pi}{k^2} \\frac{(2J+1)}{(2s_1+1)(2s_2+1)} \\frac{\\Gamma^2/4}{(E-E_R)^2 + \\Gamma^2/4}\n Where E is the center-of-mass energy, E_R is the resonance energy, and \\Gamma is the resonance width.\n\n\n\nThis is a cool example I brought because there are resonances in all three particle pairs. There are resonances in these two, and these two as well.\nWhy is there a larger probability increase when the proton and pion are near resonance? The same applies to the K\\pi system on the right side, not just the two lines on the left. Let’s understand the lines—we’ll come back to this in two lectures, but let’s quickly identify them.\n\nAll horizontal lines—which resonances are these? In which mass distribution? This will give us a peak. Looking at the blue plot, the K\\pi invariant mass m_{K\\pi} is fixed, and the probability peaks at a certain value.\nAll these lines correspond to resonances in the K\\pi system. What particle decays to K\\pi? The K^* (K-star). So these are K^* resonances.\nNow, let’s look at the vertical lines. In which system? By varying m_{K\\pi}, we scan the energy of another system. Think of this as a projectile. These lines correspond to a fixed mass of the proton-K system m_{pK}. Moving along the axis scans m_{K\\pi}.\nIf you expand it, you’ll see the lines correspond to resonances in the pK system—the \\Lambda or \\Sigma resonances. I’m pointing to the proton-K resonance.\nThe third combination is the pion-proton system, which gives the \\Delta resonances. Another plot can help here because it’s nice to see that the lines are parallel to the sides of the Dalitz plot triangle.\n\nThis line is the same as this one, parallel to one side. The \\Lambda resonances are parallel to another side. At this point, you can also see the \\Delta resonance, which is the line here, parallel to the third side. It’s a bit trickier to see the \\Delta resonance here, but it’s there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor three-body decays like K\\pi p, the Dalitz plot variables are: \nm_{12}^2 = (p_1 + p_2)^2, \\quad m_{23}^2 = (p_2 + p_3)^2\n where p_i are the 4-momenta of the decay products. These help identify resonance structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n0.6 Angular Distribution Inhomogeneity in Decay Bands Due to Particle Spin\nOkay, questions about the angular distribution.\nLet me finish this discussion and move to today’s topic: the angular distribution for a decay within one band.\n\nConsider the phase space resonance here. As we discussed before: * When traversing the Dalitz plot * Moving through phase space from one end to another while keeping the invariant mass fixed * We change the angle\nThis explores different angular configurations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe angular dependence reveals inhomogeneities—even within the band, one edge may have a different probability than the other. This is due to spin effects in particle decays.\n\n\n\nLet’s sit in the rest frame of the K\\pi system where this band occurs and traverse phase space by varying the angle.\n\nParticles often prefer certain alignments. For example:\n\nThey may favor being parallel rather than perpendicular\nThis is less probable kinematically\n\nSuch preferences arise because particles have spin.\nThe intermediate resonance (here, the K^*) is not a scalar—it has spin. This spin causes:\n\nInhomogeneities in angular distributions\nEffects on the Dalitz plot\n\n\nFor spin-1 particles like vector mesons, the angular distribution follows:\n\n\\frac{d\\Gamma}{d\\cos\\theta} \\propto 1 + \\alpha \\cos^2\\theta\n\nwhere \\alpha measures the asymmetry.\n\nMore generally, for a spin-J resonance, the distribution is:\n\nW(\\theta) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2J} a_k P_k(\\cos\\theta)\n\nwhere: * P_k are Legendre polynomials * a_k depend on the spin density matrix\n\nThe helicity amplitudes squared determine the angular dependence:\n\n|A_\\lambda(\\theta)|^2 = |d^J_{\\lambda,\\Delta\\lambda}(\\theta)|^2\n\nwhere: * d^J are Wigner d-functions * \\Delta\\lambda is the helicity difference\n\nThis spin-driven anisotropy is why we observe non-uniform angular distributions.\n\n\n0.7 Angular Distributions and Spin Determination in Particle Decays\nVery good. So 15 minutes before the end, we start with today’s lecture.\n\nAngular distribution is a very powerful tool to understand the properties of particles. As we already discussed, it is our way to measure spin, parity, and other quantum numbers in particle interactions.\n\nParticles with higher spin prefer more bumpy, more spiky angular distributions.\nParticles with lower spin—if everything is scalar—produce no asymmetries at all, no structures in the angular distributions.\n\nBy looking at the angular distribution, especially in the rest frame of the particle decay, one examines the ratio of aligned kinematics to other types of kinematics. From this, one can infer information about the spin.\n\nFor most of the particles discovered so far, the quantum numbers are not initially known. We discover particles as bumps in the spectrum, and the next step is to determine their properties and quantum numbers. This is done by looking at angular distributions.\nMost of the time, it is as simple as looking at the Dalitz plot and seeing if there is a minimum in the angular distribution. If the distribution has several structures—nodes and maxima—these indicate the spin.\nFor scalar particles in the final state, the nodes directly tell you the spin:\n\nOne node corresponds to spin 1.\nTwo nodes correspond to spin 2.\nThree nodes correspond to spin 3.\n\nThe intensity vanishes at certain points, creating dark spots. However, if the particles are not scalar—and most of the time they are not—the situation becomes more complicated.\n\nLet me give an example of scalar resonances. Here, let’s quickly check what spin they have. - The spin of the proton is 1/2. - The spin of the kaon (K) and pion (\\pi) is 0. - The spin of the lambda (\\Lambda) is the same as the proton, but the spin averages out in the distribution due to the lack of polarization.\nIf you consider a specific spin projection of the \\Lambda and proton, you would again see nodes and zeros in the angular distribution. But since we do not polarize the initial state or measure the spin of the final state, everything is averaged. As a result, you no longer have minima or nodes—the structures are smoothed out.\n\nA particle with spin J can have 2J + 1 projections onto the quantization axis. Consider a particle with spin J. There is a z-axis to quantize the spin, and the operator J_z measures the projection m.\nThe state |J, m\\rangle can be thought of as a vector with 2J + 1 components. Operators in this space are matrices that act on these vectors, producing either the same state (as an eigenstate) or a mixture of states.\nWhen you rotate the state, you do not get a single state but a mixture of different projections. Unlike classical vectors, you cannot adjust the rotation to get a pure projection. The coefficients for these mixtures are tabulated and known as Wigner D-functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Rotation Formula: The most general rotation is described by three Euler angles (\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma). In particle physics conventions: 1. First rotate by \\phi about the z-axis. 2. Then rotate by \\theta about the y-axis. 3. Finally, rotate by \\gamma about the z-axis again.\n\n\n\n\nLet me be more concrete. Suppose I rotate about the y-axis. I have the axes x, y, z forming a right-handed triple. The rotation operator J_y has zeros on the diagonal and coefficients above and below. To apply the rotation, you use the matrix exponential e^{-i \\beta J_y}.\nThe Wigner D-function for a general rotation is given by:\n\nD^J_{m'm}(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma) = \\langle J, m' | \\mathcal{R}(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma) | J, m \\rangle = e^{-i \\alpha m'} d^J_{m'm}(\\beta) e^{-i \\gamma m}\n\nHere, d^J_{m'm}(\\beta) is the reduced Wigner d-matrix for rotations about the y-axis.\nFor example, if I tell you we have a spin-1 state initially aligned perpendicular to the y-axis and rotated by 30 degrees, you can look up the D-functions to find the composition of the final state.\nThe Wigner D-function for this is:\n\nD^J_{m'm}(\\phi, \\theta, \\gamma) = e^{-i \\phi m'} d^J_{m'm}(\\theta) e^{-i \\gamma m}\n\nThe z-rotations introduce simple phase factors, while the y-rotation is more complex and involves the d-matrix.\n\nNote: The D-functions are essential for describing how quantum states transform under rotations in particle physics.\n\n\n0.8 Spin-1/2 Rotation and Wigner D Functions in Particle Decay Chains\nLet’s consider a small example of spin-1/2 rotation. I’ll rotate the state |1/2, 1/2\\rangle by 30 degrees about the y-axis. This will give a combination of |1/2, 1/2\\rangle and |1/2, -1/2\\rangle. I want you to quickly tell me the coefficients.\nThese coefficients are found in the same tables as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients—they are closely related. This is about the SU(2) group, and you can look up the numbers in the Clebsch-Gordan tables.\nSince 30 degrees is not a standard angle, we won’t go into details here, but we may explore this more in the seminar. Just remember that the Wigner D-matrix for spin-1/2 is simple:\n\nD^{1/2}_{m'm}(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(\\theta/2) & -\\sin(\\theta/2) \\\\\n\\sin(\\theta/2) & \\cos(\\theta/2)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wigner D-matrix for spin-1/2 rotations can be computed using the matrix exponential: \nD^{j}(\\theta) = \\exp(-i\\theta J_y)\n where J_y is the angular momentum operator for y-axis rotations.\n\n\n\nI should have picked 60 degrees—for 30 degrees, the half-angle is 15 degrees, which is less convenient. So here, the coefficients would be \\cos(15^\\circ) and \\sin(15^\\circ).\nAny questions about the Wigner D-functions? Could you now compute rotations for any spin projection? It’s straightforward, right?\nOne important note: the convention has a minus sign. If you want to compute the matrix exponential yourself, recall that in previous exercises, we derived these matrices. You can do this numerically using Python or Julia—just compute the matrix exponential. Alternatively, you can look up the Wigner D-functions, but be careful with conventions.\n\nMathematica, for example, uses the opposite convention—it has a plus sign here and some indices swapped. Be aware of that.\nWikipedia is the most reliable source for checking conventions—search for “Wigner D-functions,” and it provides tables and explanations.\nThe SymPy library in Python and ROOT both implement these functions correctly. Just be cautious with Mathematica.\n\n\nLet me emphasize: what we’ve discussed so far has nothing to do with weak or strong interactions. This is purely about rotations and the rotational group.\nThe remarkable thing is that to understand particle behavior and angular distributions, you don’t need much from strong interactions. You only need the general properties of the rotation group.\n\nAngular distributions are determined by how space rotates, with just a small input from strong interactions—namely, the preference for certain spin states during particle production.\nBut the decay asymmetries and kinematics are entirely governed by the quantum rotation group.\n\nThis is amazing because it means we now have a general recipe to construct any particle decay chain and predict its angular distribution.\n\nThe text now uses Markdown elements to improve readability while preserving all original content.\n\n\n0.9 Rotational Properties and Aligned Kinematics in Cascade Decays\nFor simplicity, we are going to consider aligned kinematics. We will treat X_3 as different decay products - one particle from the initial state X decays through R to particles 1 and 2.\n\nLet’s look at the center-of-mass frame (CM frame). The general expression is extendable to any cascade decays. I will give you the general formula, and we’ll focus on understanding it rather than deriving it.\nThe formula has two components: 1. A model-independent part governed by group theory and angular momentum 2. Particle interaction terms that must be inserted\n\nThe H terms represent the remaining dynamics hidden inside particle interactions. This includes effects from: - Weak interactions - Strong interactions - Electromagnetic interactions\nThe physics is contained in H, while the rest describes the rotational properties of the system. For hadronic interactions, H is often unknown because we lack a way to parameterize it.\n\nFor a particle X with spin projection \\lambda_X decaying to particles 1 and 2, we write:\n\nA = \\sum_{\\lambda_X, \\lambda_3} H_{\\lambda_X \\lambda_3} D^{J_X}_{\\lambda_X, \\lambda_0 - \\lambda_3}(0) \\times H'_{\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2} D^{J_X}_{\\lambda_X, \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2}(\\theta, \\phi)\n\nHere, D represents the rotation orientation of the decay. The first index indicates the decaying particle, and the second index describes the decay products. The spin is quantized along the direction of motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey rotational transformation: \nD^{J}_{\\lambda, \\lambda'}(\\theta, \\phi) = \\langle J, \\lambda | e^{-i\\phi J_z} e^{-i\\theta J_y} | J, \\lambda' \\rangle\n This Wigner D-matrix describes how spin projections change under rotation.\n\n\n\n\nFor particle X, the spin projection \\lambda_X is along its momentum. When X decays to particles 1 and 2, they emerge at some angle relative to X’s motion. To account for this, we must adjust the quantization axis by rotating the spin state.\nIn aligned kinematics (\\phi = \\theta = 0), the rotation simplifies. If the angles are zero, no rotation is needed, and the Wigner D-matrix reduces to a delta function:\n\nA = \\sum_{\\lambda_X} H_{\\lambda_X (\\lambda_0 - \\lambda_3)} \\delta_{\\lambda_X, \\lambda_0 - \\lambda_3} \\times H'_{\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2} D^{J_X}_{\\lambda_X, \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2}(0, 0)\n\nThis constrains \\lambda_X = \\lambda_0 + \\lambda_3, leading to the final simplified expression:\n\nA = H_0 D^{J_X}_{\\lambda_X, \\lambda_3}(\\theta) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\lambda_X = \\lambda_0 + \\lambda_3\n\n\nThis gives the amplitude in the aligned frame, where spin projections are constrained by angular momentum conservation.\n\n\n0.10 Predicting Angle Distributions and Partial Wave Analysis in Particle Decays\nHow many numbers do I need from you in order to compute? Let’s consider electromagnetic interactions or gravity. How many numbers as input are required to predict the angle distribution? The framework is essentially here, but it’s missing fundamental components.\nWhat is inside these blobs? What’s inside this block, or this blob and that blob? To predict all the values, I just need these two components.\nThe number of values here is given by the spin multiplicity factor: \n(2j_1 + 1) \\times (2j_2 + 1),\n where j_1 and j_2 are the spins of the initial particles. These values might also depend on particle masses, such as the mass of X.\n\nA similar number of parameters is needed for the other components, but there’s a reasonable way to approximate them. Often, in experimental analysis, we initially assume these are constants or depend only on particle properties.\nFor simplicity, I’ll say this one is a constant c, and this one is particle-dependent. With this, I should be able to compute the angle distribution.\n\nIn this case, I’ll fix the mass of one particle and the intensity observed along the line. The differential cross section is given by: \n\\frac{d\\Gamma}{d\\cos\\theta},\n where \\cos\\theta is used because it has a better Jacobian—no need for the \\sin\\theta Jacobian.\nThe matrix element is proportional to the transition amplitude: \n|\\mathcal{M}|^2.\n Here, \\mathcal{M} is fixed, and the distribution ranges from -1 to 1.\nIf we plot \\theta versus \\cos\\theta, \\theta = 0 corresponds to \\cos\\theta = 1, and we scan from -1 to 1. A flat distribution is one possibility.\nFor particles with spin, you often see a parabolic distribution—a second-order polynomial in \\cos\\theta: \n\\frac{d\\Gamma}{d\\cos\\theta} = A + B\\cos\\theta + C\\cos^2\\theta.\n Alternatively, you might see other shapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Note on Quantum Amplitudes: \\mathcal{M} represents the quantum transition amplitude—a probability amplitude that is squared to give the observed probability. The helicity amplitude G appears squared in experiments, as we only measure |G|^2.\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, we often deal with unpolarized decays, so distributions are averaged. You square the amplitude, sum over initial and final spin projections, and compare with experimental observations.\nThe first step in analysis isn’t to guess the amplitude but to project the angular distributions onto orthogonal polynomials. This provides a nice basis for expansion.\nAny function from -1 to 1 can be expanded in Legendre polynomials P_\\ell(\\cos\\theta), which are related to the spin of the produced particle. This is called partial wave analysis or, for differential cross sections, moment analysis.\nPartial wave analysis models the cross section with free parameters for the amplitudes, allowing you to infer what’s inside the blobs by fitting data. As a first step, projecting onto polynomials gives combinations of these parameters, though the interpretation isn’t always straightforward.\n\nWe haven’t discussed much the differences between canonical states and helicity states, only touching on how states are defined in the rest frame. For deeper insights, I recommend Chapter 4 of Martin Spearman’s Elementary Particle Theory.\nThis book provides excellent coverage, starting from the Lorentz group, introducing vectors, and lightly touching on group theory without overwhelming detail. It’s a fun and insightful read.\nFor practice, I’ve prepared an exercise using Dalitz plots from CLEO and BaBar. The labels are removed, but the axes are intact. One plot is for a D decay, another for a D_s decay. Your task is to identify the decays using kinematics and deduce the masses.\nI’ll distribute one plot per group. If you have time tomorrow at 8 AM, we can discuss further. Apologies for the delay today—thank you for your patience!\n\n\nSpin multiplicity: (2j_1 + 1) \\times (2j_2 + 1)\nAngular distribution: \\frac{d\\Gamma}{d\\cos\\theta} \\propto |\\mathcal{M}|^2\nParabolic distribution: \\frac{d\\Gamma}{d\\cos\\theta} = A + B\\cos\\theta + C\\cos^2\\theta\nPartial wave expansion: \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\cos\\theta} = \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{L} a_\\ell P_\\ell(\\cos\\theta)"

    "text": "6 Wigner D Functions and Spin Rotation Matrices\nWhen rotating a particle (rather than the coordinate system) about the Y-axis, the spin projection along the Z-axis is no longer well-defined. Instead, it becomes a superposition of states with coefficients C_{J' M'}. These coefficients are given by the Wigner D functions, which are tabulated and can be found alongside Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\nFor computational purposes, the Wigner D functions can be obtained via matrix exponentiation:\n\nD(\\theta) = e^{-i \\theta J_Y}\n\nHere, J_Y is the generator of rotations about the Y-axis, and its matrix form depends on the particle’s spin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor spin-\\frac{1}{2} particles, the rotation matrix is particularly simple.

    "text": "7 Helicity States and Spin Quantization\nWhen dealing with helicity states, we can either look up the Wigner D functions or compute them using matrix exponentiation. Let’s perform some algebra to understand how states transform when boosted and rotated.\nThe simplest approach is to define spin quantization for a moving particle. Consider the coordinate axes: X, Y, and Z, with the particle moving in the XZ direction. There are two ways to quantize spin in this scenario:\n\nHelicity basis: Quantize spin along the direction of motion.\n\nCanonical basis: Quantize spin along the Z-axis.\n\nThese two bases are not equivalent but are related. If a state has a definite spin projection along the direction of motion (helicity state), it will be a superposition of states in the canonical basis. Conversely, if a state has a definite projection along the Z-axis, it will be a combination of helicity states.\nTo construct the helicity state |P \\lambda\\rangle, we apply a sequence of transformations starting from the particle’s rest frame:\n\nBegin with a particle at rest, having spin projection \\lambda along the Z-axis.\n\nBoost the particle forward—this increases its momentum without altering the spin projection.\n\nRotate the entire system to align with the desired configuration.\n\nThe resulting state |P j \\lambda\\rangle is a helicity state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wigner D functions describe how quantum states transform under rotation. For a spin-\\frac{1}{2} particle, the rotation matrix is:\n\n\n\n\nD_{1/2}(\\theta) = e^{-i \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\sigma_Y}\n\nFor spin-1 particles, the rotation matrix is more complex:\n\nD_{1}(\\theta) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1 + \\cos \\theta}{2} & -\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{1 - \\cos \\theta}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\cos \\theta & -\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n\\frac{1 - \\cos \\theta}{2} & \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{1 + \\cos \\theta}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nThese transformations are essential for describing spin dynamics in quantum systems, particularly when dealing with moving particles and different quantization axes."

Immediately think of it as the combination of boost and rotation operators acting on the canonical states in the rest frame.\nThere are many properties we can derive for helicity states. One worth mentioning is that when you rotate a helicity state, only the momentum rotates—the helicity stays the same. If you apply further rotations, the momentum continues to rotate, but the spin remains quantized along the direction of motion, preserving the helicity value. This is evident from how the state is constructed.\nIf you introduce a rotation here (multiplying by a rotation operator), you can combine the rotations into a single one, affecting only the momentum during the boost. Boosting is trickier because when you boost this state, you insert a boost operator B (here, B_z). For any combination of boosts and rotations (B R B^{-1}), you can find equivalent pure rotations.\nWhen you evaluate this and rotate the canonical state (using the inverse operation), you obtain a combination of coefficients C_{\\lambda'}, yielding the helicity state. Applying boosts and rotations to this gives you back a helicity state.\nThe most demanding part of this exercise is finding the relation between the boosted/rotated states and the original helicity basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wigner D functions describe how states transform under rotation.

The key remaining task is to understand the composition of spin projection and directional motion. Clearly, we have a linear combination of different projections—not just a single one.\nIntuitively, if you start with a vector and boost it, the vector becomes more inclined forward. Instead of boosting twice, you can boost only once to achieve the same final momentum magnitude. This is captured in the relation between boost and rotation operations.\nFor example, applying a boost B_z to a particle at rest directly produces the desired momentum.

I inserted R'^{-1} R' here, combined these matrices, and now this gives me the canonical state when applied to the state at rest. The remaining step is to apply the rotation accelerator to the state at rest, which is described by the D functions acting on this state. Therefore, the result is a sum over coefficients C. After applying R, I obtain a linear combination with coefficients C, and for each state, I act with the inverse boost rotation to get a canonical state. Now, this is a projection labeled with \\lambda', and I have a linear combination of them.\nThe momentum P also changes because the angle is rotated. The rotated momentum is P' = R' R P_z, where P_z is the momentum after boosting along the z-axis. After the boost, the momentum becomes non-zero, and applying the rotation R' gives P'.\nNow, let’s discuss the relation between the helicity state and the canonical state. The helicity state |p, j, \\lambda\\rangle can be expressed as a linear combination of canonical states |p, j, m\\rangle_{\\text{canonical}}.

We explicitly do this by inserting the identity state here. Here, we have a lambda state for the light statement. This part is a path lambda problem, and it gives us just the state of the lambda with the same speed.\nThe matrix element we just evaluated is simply the lambda coupling. If we insert the identity, it should account for all possible combinations. Therefore, that would be a sum over lambda states. This will give us delta functions for the lambda lambda problem, allowing us to isolate a single state.\nThe final step is to apply rotation to the system. It’s good to see this once, but once you understand the idea, it becomes clear that in the case of the cascade reaction, each transition involves the product of the block helicity amplitude (the transition matrix element for the aligned transition) and the rotation.\nNow, the differential cross section depends on the angle as a function of the scattering angle. The equation involves cosine and sine matrices:\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta \\\\\n\\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nFor the spin matrix, we have an explicit numerical form, and we have two coupling constants measured in experiments.

Here, we obtain non-trivial distributions if the particle is polarized. Suppose the lambda particle is flying with a definite spin projection along its momentum direction, say +1/2. When it decays, we find that the proton is more likely to travel forward than backward.\nThis angle dependence of the proton’s momentum violates parity. Applying parity to the initial and final states flips the momentum but not the spin. The final configuration under parity would require the proton to be more likely backward, which contradicts the original observation.\nThis confirms that parity is violated in this decay process. This is consistent with the fact that weak interactions, which govern this decay, do not conserve parity. The asymmetry in the angular distribution directly demonstrates this violation."

However, if you “dive under” the plane, you enter a different world — another sheet — accessible through this gate. On this new sheet, the function has poles, including at zero, and a branch cut associated with \\sqrt{X}.\nThe function has a complex structure: on the regular complex plane, it has no singularities except for the gate. But through the gate, you reach another sheet where the behavior changes dramatically, with poles and branch cuts appearing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gate here acts as a transition point between sheets of a multisheeted Riemann surface, allowing the function to exhibit different analytic properties on each sheet.\n\n\n\nThis is how you get used to working with multisheeted complex planes — by recognizing that singularities may exist on other sheets even if they are absent on the principal sheet."

This is the energy range where such formations would be searched for.\nFor quantum numbers, we have spin-parity combinations of 1/2^- and 3/2^- due to the S-wave reference. This implies two expected states: one with spin-parity 1/2^- and another with 3/2^-.\nThere is a lower bound on the lifetime of this particle, which arises from the binding of its constituents. The decay of this particle must conserve energy. In the rest frame of the particle, the total energy available is just its mass.

When two stable particles combine, the resulting bound state can live indefinitely. For example, the deuteron is made of a proton and a neutron. While the proton is stable and the neutron has a long lifetime, the deuteron itself is stable because the neutron is so tightly bound inside that its decay is suppressed.\nThe binding mechanism suppresses the phase space available for decay, thereby increasing the particle’s lifetime. For instance, a `D meson in a bound state would live longer than an isolated D^* meson. The width \\Gamma of the bound state is smaller than the width of the D, and since the lifetime \\tau is inversely proportional to the width:\n\n\\tau \\propto \\frac{1}{\\Gamma}\n\nthe bound state has a longer lifetime.\nA similar effect occurs with the \\Sigma_c^* D system.

The physical region for this case occurs when T &gt; 0, since T represents the squared mass of two particles. In this scenario, S corresponds to particles A and B, but this becomes an impossible combination if they are on different sides, leading to S &lt; 0 and U &lt; 0.\nThe kinematic domain is roughly where U &lt; 0, S &gt; 0, and T &gt; 0.

The amplitude’s imaginary part is fixed by unitarity, so we only need to model the real part. This real part represents a point-like interaction that must be resummed to all orders.\nThere are several techniques to model the real part of the amplitude. One approach uses a polynomial expansion, which is referred to as the scattering length.\nThe amplitude can be expressed as:\n\nA = \\frac{1}{K^{-1} - i \\rho}\n\nHere, K represents the elementary (point-like) interaction, and i\\rho corresponds to the two-particle phase space. Expanding this as a Taylor series gives:\n\nA = K + K i \\rho K + K i \\rho K i \\rho K + \\dots\n\nThis series describes repeated interactions with intermediate propagations."

As an example, let me give you functions that are fully analytic. All polynomials are analytic. A rational function (polynomial divided by polynomial) is analytic except at a finite number of points, which are the zeros of the denominator.\nWhen we define a function as analytic at a point, and when we talk about a domain, it means every point in this domain is a point of analyticity. For example, \\sqrt{x} is analytic everywhere except at zero. Zero is called a branch point, where the derivative does not exist and no Taylor series converges to the function. Both conditions fail, making it non-analytic at that point.\nReal analytic functions are another interesting class—they are real-valued and analytic, with certain scalability properties. For example, \\sqrt{x} is real analytic. There is a key property called the Schwarz reflection principle: if you evaluate the function in the complex plane, it satisfies\n\nf(\\overline{z}) = \\overline{f(z)}\n\nwhere \\overline{z} is the complex conjugate.

While this diagram does not fully describe the function, it helps illustrate its behavior.\nThe stress deflection principle suggests a relationship between the upper and lower half-planes: values in the lower plane can be computed using values from the upper plane. For example, consider the function evaluated at 1 + i.\n\n1 + i = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot e^{i \\pi/4}\n\nHere, \\sqrt{2} is the magnitude (length) and \\pi/4 (45 degrees) is the angle.

The function can be evaluated either directly or by using the conjugated argument to obtain the conjugated images.\nIn the context of contour integration, if we integrate a function over a closed contour in the complex plane, the value of the integral is determined by all non-analytic features inside the contour. For poles, this is given by residues; for branch points, it involves the behavior around the discontinuity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven for discontinuous functions, the integral can be numerically well-defined. For example, integrating \\sqrt{x} over a circle of radius 1 converges despite the discontinuity at x = 0.\n\n\n\nConsider the function defined on the unit circle:\n\nAbove \\phi = 0, the function is +i.\n\nBelow \\phi = 0, it is -i.\nThis creates a jump discontinuity at \\phi = 0 (or 2\\pi).\n\nTo compute the integral, we parameterize x = e^{i \\phi}:\n\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} e^{i \\phi} \\cdot i \\, d\\phi \\cdot \\sqrt{e^{i \\phi}}\n\nSimplifying, this becomes:\n\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} e^{i \\phi (1 + \\frac{1}{2})} \\cdot i \\, d\\phi = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} e^{i \\frac{3}{2} \\phi} \\cdot i \\, d\\phi\n\nHowever, because the function is discontinuous, we cannot naively evaluate it at the endpoints. Instead, we shift the integration range to avoid the discontinuity:\n\n\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} e^{i \\frac{3}{2} \\phi} \\cdot i \\, d\\phi\n\nThis ensures the function is continuous within the new range, making the integral well-defined. The key takeaway is that even with discontinuities, careful treatment of the integration domain allows for convergent results.\nThe example illustrates how branch points and discontinuities can be handled in complex integration, similar to integrating around branch cuts."

If we shrink the contour, it becomes an integral from zero to minus one of the function evaluated above. One probably finds the same answer, which in this case will be five.\nThis is a nice property of analytic functions, where Cauchy’s theorem plays a crucial role. It states that you can deform your contour of integration freely as long as you avoid non-analytic regions. You can compute the integral along a circular contour or shrink it into a different path. For this example, I encourage you to verify that these methods yield the same result. If they don’t, we can discuss it further—I believe it’s a straightforward calculation, but we’ll proceed for now.\nWhat remains is to evaluate the imaginary part of the expression, which is simply \\sqrt{x} \\cdot i (or without the i), leading to a simple integration on the real axis.\nThe scattering amplitude is a remarkable function. Returning to our earlier discussion, we derived the optical theorem and examined the analytic structure of this function. The claim is that the amplitude is a “real magic” function—or at least part of it.\nLet’s clarify the assumptions and physical principles here. The amplitude itself is not directly measurable in experiments; we only observe its square. Access to the amplitude is indirect, mediated by observables. However, scattering theory and probability conservation impose constraints on the amplitude, particularly on its imaginary part, and dictate where this imaginary part exists.\nThe analyticity of the amplitude is a postulate—a foundational principle of our framework. It’s stronger than an assumption; it’s the building block of our series. All theories we’ve discussed so far incorporate unitarity, which is tied to causality—a property linked to analyticity.\nThe amplitude being analytic is postulated in our theory, but it’s connected to causality: events outside each other’s light cones cannot influence one another. This relationship between causality and analyticity is discussed in various textbooks, but we take it as a given here.\nUnitarity further refines this picture. The amplitude is real analytic below the threshold, meaning it has no imaginary part in this regime. The imaginary part arises only above the threshold, as it’s associated with particle production in intermediate states. Below threshold, the amplitude is purely real.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe optical theorem connects the imaginary part of the amplitude to the total cross-section, reinforcing the relationship between analyticity and unitarity.\n\n\n\nThis structure—analyticity, unitarity, and causality—forms the backbone of scattering theory, ensuring consistency with physical principles while enabling predictive power."

Consider a diagram on the x-axis representing the complex plane of energy, where S = E^2 and E is the center-of-mass energy. The amplitude A(S) is an analytic function, but we typically deal with its values only above the threshold. However, the principles of our theory allow us to extend the domain of definition into the full complex plane using analyticity.\nThis means we can treat the amplitude as a complex function, probing it not just for real interaction energies (e.g., 5 GeV) but also for complex values. This extended function exhibits singularities, particularly branch points. The absence of an imaginary part below threshold and its sudden appearance above threshold indicates the emergence of these singularities.\nFor example, the two-particle threshold introduces a square-root singularity, as seen in the prefactor of the imaginary part of the amplitude:\n\n\\text{Im} \\, A(s) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{8\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{2p}{\\sqrt{s}} |a(s)|^2\n\nHere, p is the breakup momentum, given by:\n\np = \\frac{\\lambda^{1/2}}{2\\sqrt{s}}, \\quad \\lambda^{1/2}(s, m_1^2, m_2^2) = \\sqrt{[s - (m_1 + m_2)^2][s - (m_1 - m_2)^2]}\n\nThe breakup momentum p vanishes at the threshold, where the system has minimal energy—just the sum of the particle masses. At this point, the particles have no residual momentum, and the singularity arises from the vanishing of p.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phase space factor \\frac{2p}{\\sqrt{s}} in the imaginary part of the amplitude is directly tied to the two-body phase space and vanishes at threshold, reflecting the kinematic constraints of particle production.\n\n\n\nThis structure is generic: every threshold introduces singularities, and their form depends on the number of particles involved. For a detailed derivation, refer to Gribov’s book, but the square-root singularity for the two-particle case is straightforward to derive from the properties of the imaginary part and phase space."

In this context, i\\epsilon is a small imaginary displacement indicating whether you are evaluating the function just above or just below the real axis.\nThis behavior arises due to phase space considerations. If there were no phase space configuration summations, the imaginary part could be directly related to the amplitude itself, and there might not even be branch points. However, summing over phase space configurations introduces a square-root branch point.\nThis branch point indicates that the amplitude has a singularity starting at the threshold and extending in the positive direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amplitude’s branch point structure is tied to the analytic continuation of the function across the real axis, where the function’s value changes depending on the direction of approach.\n\n\n\nTo illustrate this, consider a simple real analytic function with a branch cut, such as the square root function. The square root of x has a branch cut on the left side of the complex plane.\nTo determine where the branch cut lies, evaluate the function just above and below the real axis:\n\nFor x = -1 + i\\epsilon, \\sqrt{-1 + i\\epsilon} = i\nFor x = -1 - i\\epsilon, \\sqrt{-1 - i\\epsilon} = -i\n\nThis shows that the function changes sign when crossing the branch cut, confirming its non-analytic nature.\nA branch point splits the complex plane into distinct Riemann sheets, where the function takes different values on each sheet.

If you sit at a point with good Internet, you are likely close to a router.\nThis is analogous to our position in the house where people experience different Internet strengths. The routers represent the resonances. Here, the Y-axis represents the complex S plane, with real S on the axis and minus imaginary S indicated here. This is the same as the complex frame. A square represents the strength of your Internet when you sit on the couch. The middle of the square is the closest distance to the router (resonance), so the signal strength is highest. As you move away, the Internet weakens.\nNow, let’s make the house more complex by adding several floors. The cuts represent the map of the room. The couch where people sit is on the real axis, but the house has multiple floors with different electronics. If there is a router in another room, you can still experience its influence from your position.\nSheet one represents floor one, and sheet two represents floor two. The gate is like stairs connecting the floors. If a router is placed here, the signal strength is strong here and here, but weakens around the corner. The distance increases, and the signal must travel around the wall. The gate to the other floor allows access only from one side.\nThe picture of floors and routers is helpful but can be overwhelming.

This is a complex number, with its real and imaginary parts defining the mass and width of the resonance:\n\nMass of the pole: Real part of \\sqrt{s_0}\nWidth of the pole: Twice the imaginary part of \\sqrt{s_0} (i.e., \\Gamma = -2 \\ \\text{Im}(\\sqrt{s_0}))\n\nThese quantities relate to the experimentally observed mass and width of the resonance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pole is literally a zero of the denominator in the amplitude, and its position in the complex plane determines the physical properties of the resonance.\n\n\n\nThe influence of a pole diminishes with distance, analogous to signal strength weakening as you move away from a router. The complex plane acts like a multi-level structure, where resonances (poles) on different “floors” (sheets) still affect observations made on the real axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor practical analysis, it is often most convenient to place branch cuts where they provide the clearest access to the poles of interest.\n\n\n\nThe observed amplitude at a given point on the real axis is shaped by nearby poles, and their effects are directly visible in the data. This framework connects the mathematical structure of the amplitude to measurable physical quantities."

However, this is not the case for broad resonances.\nThe analytic structure of this function is simply a pole — there are no branch points or other complexities. A slightly more complex example involves the relativistic Wigner case, which includes a pole in the K-matrix and a square root branch point from phase space. The K-matrix is a method to incorporate poles while maintaining the correct analytic structure, and it works for multiple loops.\nThe ultimate goal in data analysis is to characterize resonances by their pole mass and width.

In quantum mechanics, the scattering length is defined through the expansion of the amplitude in terms of the breakup momentum K, which has units of GeV. Therefore, 1/a has units of GeV, and a itself is in Fermi.\nThe non-relativistic amplitude is given by:\n\nf_{NR} = \\frac{1}{a - i\\,k}\n\nIn the relativistic formulation, the amplitude becomes:\n\nf_{R} = \\frac{1}{\\tilde a^{-1} - i\\,\\frac{2k}{\\sqrt{s}}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe imaginary part of the relativistic amplitude is related to the dimensionless phase space. The first expansion term resembles the scattering length but is itself dimensionless.\n\n\n\nTo relate the two formulations, we match them at the threshold. At threshold (k \\to 0), the non-relativistic amplitude reduces to f_{NR} = a, while the relativistic amplitude becomes f_{R} = \\tilde a. However, they are not directly equal—there is a numerical constant relating them.\nThe key is to equate the numerators or denominators up to a numerical factor. The difference arises from the relativistic phase space factor:\n\n\\frac{2k}{\\sqrt{s}} = -i\\,k \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{8\\pi^2 s}\\right)\n\nAt threshold, \\sqrt{s} is the sum of the masses involved.

The dimensionless \\tilde a in the relativistic case must be rescaled by the threshold kinematics to recover the conventional scattering length a in Fermi.\n\nThe discussion also touches on meson states, such as the P_1(1400), which was initially misidentified in older data but later corrected to appear at 1600 MeV in more precise analyses. This highlights the importance of accurate measurements in determining resonance properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\pi_1 meson has quantum numbers 1^- +, which are forbidden in the standard quark model, suggesting it is a hybrid meson with gluonic excitations.

For instance, the \\pi meson has 0^- +, while the B_1 meson has 1^+ -. Decays involving these states may exhibit isospin violation, particularly when charge conjugation conservation is enforced.\nIn higher partial waves (D-wave, F-wave), the allowed orbital angular momentum states further constrain the possible quantum numbers and decay patterns of mesons.

The first convention is standard and uses two angles. This is found in the Review of Particle Physics (RPP) for experimentalists, as used by Chung and others. However, the second convention appears simpler for constructions involving helicity states, though many particle physics books do not explicitly state these conventions.\n\n\n\nThe first case corresponds to the rotation sequence R = R_z(\\phi) R_y(\\theta), where you first rotate by \\theta about the y-axis and then by \\phi about the z-axis. The second convention gives the same result when acting on a vector with only a z-component, since the initial rotation about z does nothing. However, this introduces an extra phase to the states, which is an unobservable phase.\nThe D function (capital D) is the rotational matrix for cases beyond just y-axis rotations.

These phases cancel each other, and the symmetry is only broken when mass terms are introduced. This breaks the scale symmetry. The mass term mixes the two states, so the phase appears in one combination of the \\alpha parameters and disappears in the other.\nThe mass term explicitly breaks chiral symmetry, but there is another effect: chiral symmetry is also spontaneously broken. Even if you start with no mass term in QCD, the quarks generate a non-zero expectation value through their interactions. This means the quarks appear massive even without an explicit mass term in the Lagrangian.\nThe QCD vacuum has a non-zero expectation value, expressed as:\n\n\\langle 0 |\\, \\bar{\\Psi}_L \\Psi_R \\,| 0 \\rangle \\ne 0 \\quad \\text{for } m_q = 0.\n\nThis is a spectacular result — the entire symmetry is broken. To visualize this, imagine a field space where the vacuum state is not at zero but at a shifted location. The potential of the theory has a shape similar to the Higgs potential, resembling a Mexican hat.\nWhen quantum fluctuations are integrated out, the effective potential takes this form, and the vacuum settles at a non-zero expectation value. This is the essence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The theory could have a vacuum with exact chiral symmetry (located at zero), but energetically, it is favorable for the vacuum to have a non-zero expectation value.\nThis mechanism appears in many areas of physics: superconductivity (where electron pairs form Cooper pairs), the Higgs mechanism, and other examples. The common feature is an exact symmetry at the origin of the field space, but the physical vacuum is displaced due to interactions.\nThe spontaneous breaking is driven by the shape of the potential. The interaction terms, when integrated over quantum fluctuations, produce a potential that favors a non-zero vacuum expectation value. This is the origin of the mass gap in QCD, even in the absence of explicit mass terms.\nThe current symmetry corresponds to independent transformations of the left- and right-handed components. For a global symmetry, there are eight parameters for the left-handed rotation and eight for the right-handed rotation, totaling 16 real parameters.

S is the Mandelstam variable, calculated as (P_1 + P_2)^2 for the scattering process. This S is a convenient variable to describe the scattering amplitude, where the partial wave amplitude f is a function of this single variable.\nEquivalently, one can consider the breakup momentum variable K, which represents the momentum carried by each particle. Here, S is the squared energy of the system in the center-of-mass frame, while K is the momentum of each particle in the same frame. The relationship between S and K is given by the channeling function, and the analytic structure of the amplitude is simpler in terms of K near the threshold.\nInstead of working in the S-plane, where the amplitude is analytic except for a few singularities, we now examine the K-plane and relate the structures between the two planes. Specifically, we map the following points from the S-plane to the K-plane:\n\nPoints 1 and 2: Resonances located on the second Riemann sheet with respect to the threshold in S.\n\nPoint 3: A pole on the real axis in the first Riemann sheet, corresponding to a bound state.\n\nPoint 4: A virtual state, residing on the unphysical sheet below the threshold.\n\nThe goal is to understand how these singularities and structures translate when mapped from the S-plane to the K-plane.\n\nS = 4(K^2 + m^2)\n where m is the mass of the particle.

It is easier to start by mapping the real axis first and then determine the positions of other features relative to it.\nThe real axis above the threshold corresponds to a physical region, and this physical region is preserved when mapped to the K-plane. The point where S = 0 corresponds to the threshold in the K-plane. Below the threshold, when S is smaller than the threshold value, the square root of S becomes imaginary, meaning K is also imaginary.\nThe other square root term (from the breakup momentum function) does not change sign when crossing the threshold. This term remains negative, so it does not introduce any additional complications near the threshold. However, there is a branch point somewhere between zero and the threshold on the real axis in the K-plane.\nThe region close to zero in the K-plane is more complicated due to this branch point, but the focus here is on the behavior near the threshold. The key observation is that the physical region in the S-plane maps directly to the physical region in the K-plane, while non-physical regions (below threshold) map to imaginary values in the K-plane.\nThe mapping simplifies the analysis of scattering amplitudes, particularly near thresholds, by transforming the S-plane structure into a more tractable form in the K-plane. The relationship between S and K is given by:\n\nS = 4(K^2 + m^2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle.

You can visualize this by drawing lines or curves, such as half-circles, that do not intersect the real axis (the dashed line). The exact shape (circle, bicircle, or deformed curve) does not matter as long as the mapping remains analytic.\nThe K-plane is simply a reparametrization of the S-plane. For momentum space (K-plane), there is no square root because K itself is the square root of S. A function with a square root has two Riemann sheets, but when expressed in terms of K, it simplifies to a single-sheeted analytic structure. The two-sheeted nature arises from the \\pm sign in front of the square root, which is already embedded in the K-plane.\nThe mapping is given by the squaring operation:\n\nS = K^2\n\nIn the K-plane, a domain transforms under squaring, producing a two-sheeted structure in the S-plane.

This parameter appears in the Lagrangian and action, allowing an expansion in powers of \\hbar.\nThe first term in this expansion gives the average value of the fields, which we identify as the classical field. For example, the field \\sigma can be obtained by performing an \\hbar-expansion of the Lagrangian. The leading term yields not the fluctuating quantum field but the classical average value of \\sigma in space.\nAt this level, \\sigma is no longer a function of spacetime coordinates x (i.e., it does not fluctuate) but is instead a fixed value.

In the chiral limit, where quark masses are set to zero, pions and kaons become massless (as they are Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking), but the proton remains massive. This is because the proton’s mass arises from the dynamics of quark-gluon interactions, not from the quark masses themselves.\nThe proton is composed of three quarks, but unlike pions, it is not a Goldstone boson. Pions are fluctuations of the quark condensate (the \\sigma field), while protons are excitations of this condensate with additional energy stored in their structure. The mass of the proton is thus a manifestation of the strong interaction energy within QCD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mass of hadrons (except Goldstone bosons like pions) is determined by the curvature of the QCD potential. Pions move along flat directions of the potential (no curvature, hence massless), while protons and other hadrons correspond to excitations with non-zero curvature, giving them mass.\n\n\n\nThe quark-gluon interactions in mesons also exist, but the key difference lies in the nature of their excitations. The quark condensate forms a background, and pions are small fluctuations on this background, whereas protons are more complex excitations with additional energy contributions.\nTo understand this mathematically, one can examine how the \\sigma field acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation value and how pions emerge as fluctuations along flat directions of the potential. The mass of particles corresponds to the curvature of the potential, and since pions move along directions with no curvature, they remain massless. Protons, however, involve excitations of the condensate itself, leading to their observed mass.\nThe theory does not inherently contain a mass scale for the proton; its mass emerges dynamically from the strong interaction dynamics of QCD."

This is especially true for the light quarks (u and d), whose masses are much smaller than the QCD scale of 1 GeV. Introducing small quark masses does not drastically alter the physics.\nWhen quark masses are introduced, they effectively add a linear term to the potential, slightly skewing it. The overall picture remains almost the same, but the minimum on one side becomes more pronounced. In the pion direction, there is now a curvature, making pions slightly massive. The theory, however, remains fundamentally unchanged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mexican hat potential develops a curvature in the pion direction due to quark masses, giving pions a small mass while preserving the structure of QCD.\n\n\n\nOne important quantity often discussed is the ratio of the proton mass to the pion mass, which is primarily determined by QCD interactions and does not change significantly even if quark masses are increased. Computations of properties in lattice QCD are highly dependent on the quark masses used. Interestingly, calculations appear easier when pions are slightly heavier, achieved by introducing larger quark masses. Despite this, the essential properties of the theory—such as those of mesons—do not change much.\nWhile details like particle masses and widths do change, the broader characteristics remain stable. This means that even with unphysical pion masses in simulations, we can still extract meaningful insights. The key takeaway is that these variations are a computational tool, not a fundamental limitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLattice QCD computations often use artificially heavy quark masses for numerical stability, but the extracted physics remains representative of the real-world theory.\n\n\n\nThe mass of particles like pions changes with quark masses, but the underlying dynamics of QCD—such as the role of the quark condensate and chiral symmetry breaking—are preserved. This allows us to study QCD effectively even with non-physical parameters."

Due to the finite box size and cyclic boundaries, the proton interacts with its mirror images.\nWhy use periodic boundary conditions? The alternatives, such as hard-wall boundaries where the wave function vanishes at the edges, introduce quantization effects and restrict the wave function’s behavior. Periodic boundary conditions avoid this by allowing the wave function to remain continuous across the box edges.\nIn quantum field theory, periodic boundary conditions are advantageous because they preserve translational symmetry and avoid artificial quantization of momenta. This is particularly important in lattice QCD, where the wave function should not be forced to zero at the boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHard-wall boundaries impose vanishing wave functions at the edges, while periodic boundaries allow the wave function to propagate smoothly across the box.

Once your lattice is large compared to the inverse mass of the pion (1/m_\\pi), your computations closely approximate infinite-volume quantities. However, these are still box quantities, meaning the physics is constrained to the box. When the box size L becomes infinite, you approach true infinite-volume physics, and the computations reflect the physical situation.\nDiscretization error is another consideration. The more steps you take in the lattice, the better the approximation. Increasing the volume of the box significantly would make computations more intensive, but the box is never truly empty. Even if no explicit particles are placed inside, the vacuum itself contains fluctuating quantum fields. These fields interact, and the box is filled with correlated fields, visualized as bubbles appearing and disappearing in the vacuum.\nAdjusting discretization by varying grid spacing is important. The lattice spacing a affects the scales probed in the theory. For large a, confinement may break down, as the theory loses its non-perturbative properties. Therefore, small step sizes are crucial to maintain confinement and ensure accurate results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLattice computations are typically performed for multiple discretization values to demonstrate that results are not strongly affected by the choice of spacing.\n\n\n\nIn lattice QCD studies, the physical box size (e.g., 5 Fermi) is fixed, but computations are repeated for different lattice spacings (e.g., a = 0.05, 0.033, 0.02 \\ \\text{Fermi}).

While the computation remains possible, the convergence is poor because of oscillatory behavior, leading to the so-called “time problem.” A complex weight is unsuitable for the emergency fgametric to 5.\nTo address this, instead of using the Minkowski metric, one performs a transformation of time to imaginary time and adopts the Euclidean metric. For example, when computing the operator correlation function ( C(t) ), the action becomes imaginary, and the integral’s convergence improves significantly when working with real weights.\nThe Euclidean metric is introduced by replacing time with imaginary time, which effectively transforms the Lagrangian (or action) into a real-valued quantity.

We will revisit this at a more advanced level, incorporating the knowledge we’ve gained.\nTo start today’s lecture, I will briefly recap our earlier discussion on helicity and chirality, specifically examining the decay of the \\pi^{+} meson:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\pi^{+} &\\longrightarrow \\mu^{+}\\,\\nu_{\\mu}\\,, \\\\\n\\pi^{+} &\\longrightarrow e^{+}\\,\\nu_{e}\n\\end{align}\n\nThese decays illustrate key concepts in weak interactions and lepton universality. Comparing these processes will help us understand the underlying physics."

The inequality shows that the electron channel is suppressed compared to the muon channel due to the smaller mass of the electron.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChirality is directly related to spin orientation in the high-mass limit, which is why we can clearly observe chiral properties in the decay products.\n\n\n\nThe weak interaction vertex ( V-A ) produces particles in their chiral configurations. For example, the W boson decay produces a left-handed electron and a left-handed neutrino. Since the neutrino is massless, it is purely left-handed, while the electron has both left and right components, with the right component suppressed by m_e / E.\nIn the center-of-momentum frame, the spins of the decay products must sum to the spin of the pion ( J = 0 ). For the electron and neutrino, their spins are 1/2, and they must be back-to-back to conserve angular momentum. However, flipping the spin of the right-handed electron is allowed but suppressed by m_e / E, whereas the neutrino cannot be flipped due to its zero mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe suppression factor differs for electrons and muons because m_e \\ll m_\\mu. For the pion decay into muons, the muon is nearly non-relativistic, so the chirality suppression is less pronounced.\n\n\n\nThe matrix elements for \\pi^+ \\to e^+ \\nu_e and \\pi^+ \\to \\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu are thus differently suppressed, with the electron channel being heavily suppressed due to its small mass.

    "section": "3 Phase Space and Energy Release in Pion Decay",
    "text": "3 Phase Space and Energy Release in Pion Decay\nThe expression for the phase space ratio in pion decay is:\n  \n\\frac{\\Phi(\\,e^{+}\\nu_{e})}{\\Phi(\\,\\mu^{+}\\nu_{\\mu})} = \\frac{s-m_{e}^{2}}{s-m_{\\mu}^{2}} &gt; 1  \n\nHowever, this does not fully explain the observed decay rates. The correct answer is that the ratio is significantly less than one, which is why pions decay predominantly to muons rather than electrons.\nPhase space represents the number of possible configurations in the decay. For two-body decays, it is determined by angular configurations, but there is also an energy-dependent factor. The larger the energy release, the larger the phase space.\nFor the muon decay channel, the initial energy is given by the pion mass, and the final state includes particles with their own masses. The energy release is the difference between these masses. In the electron channel, the mass difference is small, so the energy release is tiny. In contrast, for the muon channel, most of the energy goes into kinetic energy because the neutrino is nearly massless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phase space is larger when more energy is released, favoring the muon channel despite the phase space ratio formula suggesting otherwise.\n\n\n\nThe suppression of the electron channel is due to the small mass difference, which limits the available phase space compared to the muon channel. This explains why pions decay predominantly to muons.\n\n$$ ## Magnetic Moment of the Muon and Quantum Corrections\nBecause the pion is massless and the electron is almost massless, the phase space is much larger. For the second case, however, this does not compensate the suppression. Let’s consider the phase space of the electron channel. There is an angle integral which I’m going to implement now, and the neutrino phase space is something like that. The breakup momentum is something I need to evaluate, and I will double-check the calculation.\nThe challenge function is the mass of the pion, and another channel function is zero. The chaining function is xyz, so it would be x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2 \\Delta E. Once I drop the terms x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2x^2 - 2yz - 2zx, and then if b = 0, this term is dropped. The remaining expression is just the difference, which is a full square. I then substitute (s - m_e^2) / (s - m_\\mu^2). This full square is dropped because of the 1/2 factor, and this is the answer.\nThis node does not compensate the suppression, so the dominant decay of the pion is the muon channel. It’s important to realize the steps we’ve taken because this is a nice piece of physics. It explains how parity violation was discovered—by observing that the muon is the predominant decay product. For this vertex to be V - A weak interaction, you need this term to violate parity.\nAnother interesting fact is that in this decay, the muon is produced polarized. The pion doesn’t carry spin, and the neutrino is not detected—it just flies away. The muon, however, is produced polarized. In 1967, an experiment confirmed this. What’s remarkable about the muon is that it is self-analyzing. Its decay to an electron, neutrino, and antineutrino has an angular distribution of electrons that indicates the muon’s polarization.\nThis is a very elegant setup. You can analyze the vertex here, which has a V - A current that violates parity. The axial term \\gamma_5 would violate parity, and you can check this easily. The second decay, the muon decay, produces a charged track. The angular distribution of this track in the muon’s rest frame tells you whether the muon is polarized.\nIf the muon is not polarized, the electron directions are equally probable in the helicity frame. But if it is polarized, the forward direction is preferred—aligned with the spin. The muon carries its spin as it flies, and in its rest frame, you only have spin information. This is called the KTG frame. In this frame, the electron preferentially moves in a certain direction, though it can go anywhere—just with different probabilities.\nIntegrating over the electron energies reveals that this is the preferred configuration, even for a linearly polarized muon beam. Shortly after, the same technique was used to measure something more fundamental: the magnetic moment of the muon.\nWe discussed this in the second lecture when we calculated the quark content of the proton’s magnetic moment. Let me remind you what it is. The magnetic moment of a particle describes its interaction with a magnetic field. For a point-like fermion, it is given by the Bohr magneton and the gyromagnetic factor:\n\n\\vec{\\mu} = \\frac{e}{2m} g \\vec{S}, \\quad g = 2 \\ \\text{(Dirac, pointlike)}\n\nThis is a fundamental quantity, and g = 2 for a fermion. However, for the proton, we found g \\approx 2.8. How can this be if the proton is a fermion? This discrepancy indicates that the proton is not pointlike—it is made of quarks.\nIn the quark model, we computed the correct value by considering the charges and masses of the constituent quarks. For the proton, the charge e is +1, but for quarks, it is fractional. The masses are taken as constituent quark masses, around 0.3 GeV for up and down quarks.\nFor the muon, however, we do not doubt that it is an elementary particle with no internal structure. We expect g = 2, but this is only true at first order. There are corrections from virtual processes that make g not exactly 2. The quantity a = (g - 2)/2 is used to describe these corrections.\nThe muon’s g - 2 is one of the most precisely known numbers in physics. It is a key test of quantum field theory and may hint at new physics if discrepancies with theory are found. $$"

By probing the muon with a photon source, g reveals how the muon “sees” light. If the muon were composite, this measurement would resolve its internal structure. However, in this case, the corrections come from quantum loop effects at the vertex."

Since pions produce polarized muons, the initial spin configuration is already aligned for measurement.\nWhen the muon enters the magnetic field, its spin begins precessing as it moves along the circular path. The spin orientation is measured by detecting the electrons from muon decay. The muon bunch contains millions of particles, and as they decay, the emitted electrons are observed.\nThe setup includes lead glass calorimeters placed inside the ring. Lead glass is used because its high atomic number (Z) ensures particles deposit all their energy within the material. The glass remains transparent to light, allowing photosensors at the ends to collect the energy deposited by incoming particles.\nThese calorimeters measure the electron flux. If the muon spin points outward, fewer electrons are detected compared to when it points inward.\n\n$$ ## Hadronic Contributions to Anomalous Magnetic Moment\nThe spin precession frequency \\omega_s is measured in experiments like the muon g-2 experiment. If the spin points outwards, there is a loss of detected electrons, while if it points inwards, more electrons are observed. This creates fluctuations in the energy deposit along the circular path.\nIn the g-2 measurement setup, the digital flow shows time on the x-axis and a signal related to energy deposit. The frequency of rotation remains constant because it is determined by the charge of the electron. Over time, muons in the batch decay, causing the overall energy deposit to decrease exponentially. However, this decay is modulated by spin rotation fluctuations.\nThe analysis is blinded, meaning the true frequency is hidden until the final results are revealed. For instance, in a recent press release, the analysts wrote down the real frequency on a piece of paper in an envelope beforehand. During the press conference, the envelope was opened, and the true frequency was entered to unblind the results.\nThe experiment measures \\omega_s, but the key observable is the difference between \\omega_s and the cyclotron frequency \\omega_c. If these frequencies were identical, the spin configuration would propagate uniformly, and no fluctuations would be observed. The experiment’s sensitivity comes from this difference.\nMuons are naturally polarized when produced in pion decays due to the weak interaction vertex, which enforces a specific chirality. This polarization is crucial for the experiment. The next-generation experiment is currently underway, with the primary challenge being the homogeneity of the magnetic field. Even slight inhomogeneities introduce uncertainties because the integral of the magnetic field experienced by the muon varies.\nThe precision of the experiment is quantified in parts per billion (ppb). The current experimental uncertainty is 63 ppb, while the theoretical prediction is around 100 ppb.\nThe hadronic contributions to the muon’s anomalous magnetic moment are significant. Beyond QED corrections, there are electroweak and hadronic effects. Two prominent hadronic contributions are:\n\nHadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP): A photon produces hadrons, which then recombine into a photon. This is represented by the diagram where a photon splits into hadrons and reforms.\n\nHadronic Light-by-Light (HLbL) Scattering: This involves photons interacting via intermediate hadrons. The process can be visualized as light entering and exiting a hadronic blob, with intermediate hadron states like \\pi^0 or \\eta mesons, which decay into two photons.\n\nThe quantum numbers (J^{PC}) of the intermediate hadrons must match those of the photon for the process to occur.\n$$"

    "text": "11 Understanding Subtraction in Dispersion Relations\nThis function allows us to recover the full function from its imaginary part. It tells us what the function is equal to here, and using this relation, we can determine it anywhere in the complex plane.\nThis is an advanced subject in dispersion relations, but it’s part of the coursework. It’s a little exercise that helps you understand better how dispersion works. The key concept here is subtraction.\nWhen people say they perform this dispersion relation with one subtraction, it means two poles are introduced. The integral involves the variable s', and the term s - a appears outside the integral. This term vanishes when s = a, so to maintain the correct relation, we include g(a) explicitly.\nThis is called a one-subtracted dispersion relation. The simplest subtraction occurs at a = 0, giving:\n\ng(s) = g(0) + \\frac{s}{\\pi} \\int_{s_{\\text{th}}}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Im}g(s')}{s'(s'-s)} \\, ds'\n\nHere, the extra s in the denominator comes from the subtraction. This is necessary when the function does not decrease fast enough at infinity. In such cases, you must use a one-subtracted or even a twice-subtracted relation.\nFor a twice-subtracted dispersion relation, the term (s - a) is raised to the second power, modifying the integral further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtractions are essential when the function’s high-energy behavior does not satisfy the conditions for an unsubtracted dispersion relation.

When the function is real in the vicinity and we approach the threshold, the imaginary part appears with opposite signs on either side of the cut. This is how analyticity introduces the imaginary part consistently from both sides of the cut.\nFor example, consider the function X where:\n\nX - X = \\int \\frac{X}{5}\n\nThe imaginary part of \\sqrt{X(1 - X)} can be evaluated explicitly, and we must also include the value at zero, which is one. This may seem surprising, but it works mathematically because we started with an analytic function.\nThe imaginary part of the square root is hyperscaling, so we can express it as a real mathematical relation. Now, we relate the imaginary part of this block to the cross section through the optical theorem. The cross section is the observable, and it corresponds to the imaginary part.\nThe R ratio’s denominator is the theoretical cross section for e^{+}e^{-}\\!\\to\\!\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, which is not directly measured in experiments but is very close to what we observe. The exercise sheet highlights the small differences between theory and experiment.\nThe R ratio reveals all the resonances that can appear, such as the \\rho, \\phi, and \\Upsilon.

Today’s lecture will focus more on physics, while next week will cover meta-issues and how the hadron community functions. I will provide background on research structure, collaborations, and how scientists operate in the hadron physics domain. Next week will have less physics, though I may spend the first 20 minutes reviewing recent discoveries and current experimental progress in the hadron physics community.\nToday, I will discuss how hadron physics is used outside its direct domain, particularly its role in other studies. I considered dedicating this lecture to either CP violation, where hadron physics plays a key role, or to the g-2 (muon magnetic moment) and its hadronic contributions. I decided to focus on the latter, as it connects to several topics we’ve already discussed.\nThe exercise sheet will cover the R-ratio, which was originally planned for earlier lectures but was postponed. Now, we will revisit it at a more advanced level, incorporating additional problems and applying the knowledge we’ve gained.\nTo begin today’s lecture, I will briefly recap a previous discussion on helicity and chirality, specifically examining the decay of the \\pi^+ meson:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\pi^{+} &\\longrightarrow \\mu^{+}\\,\\nu_{\\mu}\\,, \\\\\n\\pi^{+} &\\longrightarrow e^{+}\\,\\nu_{e}\\,.\n\\end{align}\n\nThis comparison will help us transition into today’s topic."

    "text": "13 Introduction to Lecture Topics and Decay Analysis\nWe will compare the decays involving a neutrino. Start by drawing the two-body decay in the thrust frame of the decaying particle, indicating momenta and chirality. The vertex here corresponds to a weak interaction, meaning the produced particles inherit chiral properties (left- or right-handed).\nSince chirality relates to spin orientation in the high-mass limit, the diagram will clearly display this property. From these chiral configurations, estimate the ratio of the matrix elements for the first and second cases. Consider which phase space is larger — the first or the second — and determine which decay is more probable for the particle P.\nLet’s discuss the first case: the decay \\pi^+ \\to \\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu compared to \\pi^+ \\to e^+ \\nu_e. The weak interaction governs these processes, and chirality plays a key role in the matrix elements.

    "text": "14 Chirality and Spin Configurations in Pion Decay\nLet’s discuss the first point. The kinematics indicate chirality in the center-of-momentum decay frame. The neutrino is produced as a particle (not an antineutrino) because the electron comes with its antiparticle.\nThe weak interaction vertex involves a V - A structure, represented by \\gamma^\\mu (1 - \\gamma^5). This projects the quark current into left-handed (LH) and right-handed (RH) components. For example, a term like \\bar{u} \\gamma^\\mu (1 - \\gamma^5) u ensures the quark is left-handed and the antiquark is right-handed.\nIn pion decay, the W boson vertex produces the final-state particles in their chiral configurations:\n\nThe positron (e^+) is right-handed.\n\nThe electron (e^-) would be left-handed.\n\nThe neutrino (\\nu_e) is purely left-handed because it is massless.\n\nFor a right-handed particle, the spin component aligned with momentum is dominant. For a left-handed particle, the opposite is true. In the center-of-momentum frame, the spins of the produced particles (e.g., e^+ and \\nu_e) are both 1/2, leading to a back-to-back configuration. The total spin sum must match the pion’s spin (0), so certain spin configurations are forbidden or suppressed.\nThe neutrino, being massless, has no right-handed component. However, the electron can have a suppressed right-handed component proportional to m_e / E. This suppression is stronger for the electron than for the muon due to their mass difference:\n\n\\frac{m_e}{E} \\ll \\frac{m_\\mu}{E} \\implies \\frac{|\\mathcal{M}_e|^2}{|\\mathcal{M}_\\mu|^2} \\ll 1\n\nFor the pion decay \\pi^+ \\to \\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu, the muon is nearly non-relativistic because the pion mass is only slightly larger than the muon mass. Thus, the chirality suppression is less severe compared to the electronic decay \\pi^+ \\to e^+ \\nu_e, where the electron is highly relativistic and the suppression is stronger."

The correct answer is that the ratio is significantly less than one. This explains why the pion decays predominantly to a muon and neutrino rather than an electron and neutrino.\nThe phase space represents the number of kinematic configurations available in the decay. For two-body decays, it reduces to angular configurations, which are the same for both cases. But there is also an energy-dependent factor, which determines how much energy is released in the decay.\nThe energy release is larger when the mass difference between the initial and final states is greater. For the pion decay:\n\nThe initial energy is given by the pion mass.\n\nThe final-state particles (e.g., \\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu or e^+ \\nu_e) carry their own masses.\n\nIn the case of \\pi^+ \\to e^+ \\nu_e, the energy release is tiny because the electron mass is negligible, and most of the energy goes into kinetic energy. For \\pi^+ \\to \\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu, the muon mass is much larger, so the energy release is smaller in comparison. This difference in phase space favors the muonic decay."

    "text": "16 Parity Violation and Muon Polarization in Pion Decay\nBecause the pion is massless (or nearly massless for the electron case), the phase space is much larger for the electron decay channel. However, this does not compensate for the suppression in the second case.\nFor the phase space of the electron channel, we evaluate the breakup momentum and include an angle integral. The breakup momentum can be expressed in terms of the squared invariant mass s and the particle masses. The challenge function is constructed as:\n\nf(s, m_{e}) = s - m_{e}^2\n\nFor another channel, the function would be:\n\nf(s, m_{\\mu}) = s - m_{\\mu}^2\n\nThe full expression involves terms like x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2xy - 2yz - 2zx, but when b = 0, certain terms drop out, leaving only the difference in energies. The final phase space ratio is:\n\n\\frac{\\Phi(e^{+}\\nu_{e})}{\\Phi(\\mu^{+}\\nu_{\\mu})} = \\frac{s - m_{e}^2}{s - m_{\\mu}^2}\n\nThis ratio does not compensate for the suppression, so the dominant decay of the pion is to a muon and neutrino.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parity-violating nature of the weak interaction ( V - A structure) is crucial here. The axial ( A ) term violates parity, which is why the pion predominantly decays to a muon rather than an electron.\n\n\n\nAnother key observation is that the muon produced in pion decay is polarized. Since the pion is spinless, the decay products (muon and neutrino) must conserve angular momentum. The neutrino is not directly detectable, but the muon’s polarization can be inferred from its subsequent decay:\n\n\\mu^+ \\to e^+ \\nu_e \\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}\n\nThe muon is “self-analyzing” because the angular distribution of the emitted electron in the muon’s rest frame reflects its polarization. If the muon is unpolarized, the electron emission is isotropic. However, if the muon is polarized, the electron preferentially aligns with the spin direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1967 experiment confirmed this polarization effect, providing direct evidence for parity violation in weak interactions.\n\n\n\nThe V - A structure of the weak interaction ensures that the muon decay vertex also violates parity. The angular distribution of the electron in the muon’s rest frame is sensitive to the muon’s polarization, making this a powerful experimental signature.\nIn the helicity frame of the muon, if the muon is polarized, the electron is more likely to be emitted in the forward direction (aligned with the spin). This asymmetry is a direct consequence of parity violation."

    "text": "30 Threshold and Integration in Particle Production\nLet’s look at the expression for e^+e^- \\to \\text{hadrons} once again. Here, \\alpha is the electromagnetic coupling constant, and m_\\mu is the mass of the muon. The key part is the integral and its denominator. The kernel K is a mathematical function related to the spin of the particles, consisting of logarithms and rational functions. For scalar particles, K would simplify to 1, and R represents the experimental ratio.\nThe integral starts at the threshold of the hadron production reaction. The idea is to “cut” the loop and identify which particles can be produced on-shell inside this block. The lowest threshold determines the integration limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lowest threshold corresponds to the lightest possible on-shell particles that can be produced.\n\n\n\nQuarks cannot be on-shell, so the lightest particles are two pions (2\\pi). Thus, the integration begins at the threshold for 2\\pi production. These pions must satisfy the energy-momentum constraints of the reaction."

    "section": "33 Dispersion Relation and Contour Integration",
    "text": "33 Dispersion Relation and Contour Integration\nThe dispersion relation is a consequence of the Cauchy theorem, and it provides a useful representation for certain functions. Consider a function f(s) that is real analytic in the domain below a cut, with the cut starting at a threshold s_{\\text{th}}. We can write:\n\nf(s) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{s_{\\text{th}}}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Im}f(s' + i0)}{s' - s} \\, ds'\n\nNow, suppose we have a function G(s) that is real analytic below the cut. We can represent it using contour integration:\n\nG(s) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{G(s_1)}{s_1 - s} \\, ds_1\n\nHere, C is a contour enclosing the point s. By deforming the contour, we encounter singularities—primarily the pole at s_1 = s—and contributions from the cut. The integral splits into two parts: one from a large circular contour and another from the cut along the real axis.\nThe key property we use is the behavior of G(s) near the cut. For s just above the cut (s + i0) and below (s - i0), the function satisfies:\n\nG(s + i0) = G^*(s - i0)\n\nThis means the real parts are equal, and the imaginary parts differ by a sign. To illustrate, take the example of G(x) = \\sqrt{1 - x}, which has a cut starting at x = 1. For x &lt; 1, the function is real and analytic. For x &gt; 1, we evaluate:\n\nG(x + i0) = \\sqrt{-(x - 1) - i0} = i \\sqrt{x - 1}\n \nG(x - i0) = -i \\sqrt{x - 1}\n\nThis confirms the relation G(s + i0) = G^*(s - i0).\nUsing this, we can rewrite the contour integral. The contribution from the cut reduces to an integral over the discontinuity of G(s) across the cut:\n\nG(s) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\left( \\int_{\\text{cut}} \\frac{G(s_1 + i0) - G(s_1 - i0)}{s_1 - s} \\, ds_1 + \\text{circle contribution} \\right)\n\nThe discontinuity is 2i \\operatorname{Im} G(s_1 + i0), so:\n\nG(s) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{s_{\\text{th}}}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Im} G(s_1 + i0)}{s_1 - s} \\, ds_1 + \\text{circle term}\n\nIf G(s) decays sufficiently fast as |s| \\to \\infty, the circle contribution vanishes, leaving only the dispersion integral. This is the dispersion relation, which allows us to reconstruct the full function from its imaginary part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dispersion relation relies on real analyticity and the behavior of the function near its branch cut. It is a powerful tool for recovering a function from its discontinuity."

It’s quite amazing—it tells us what the function is equal to here, and using this relation, we can determine it anywhere in the complex plane.\nThis is an advanced subject in dispersion relations, but it’s part of the coursework. It’s a little exercise that helps you understand better how dispersion works. The key concept here is subtraction.\nWhen people say they use the dispersion relation with one subtraction, it’s not just one subtraction—two poles are introduced. The integral involves s' (the integration variable), and s - a appears outside the integral. This term vanishes when s = a, so to maintain the correct relation, we include g(a) here. This is called the one-subtracted dispersion relation.\nThe simplest subtraction occurs at a = 0. Then, the relation becomes:\n\ng(s) = g(0) + \\frac{s}{\\pi} \\int_{s_{\\text{th}}}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Im}g(s')}{s'(s' - s)} \\, ds'\n\nThis extra s in the denominator is necessary when the function does not decrease fast enough at high energies. In such cases, you must use a one-subtracted or even a twice-subtracted relation. The twice-subtracted form involves raising (s - a) to the second power."

This works surprisingly well, even for functions like the square root of x.\nWhen discussing real analyticity, we mean the function is real for real inputs up to a certain threshold. This property implies specific relations for the function’s behavior.\nA key observation is that when a function is real in a certain region, the imaginary part must appear consistently across a branch cut. Specifically, if the function is real on one side of the cut, the imaginary part will emerge with opposite signs on either side of the cut. This is a consequence of analyticity — the imaginary part cannot appear arbitrarily but must follow this symmetry.\nFor example, consider a function that is real along the real axis. As we approach the branch cut, the imaginary part will manifest with a positive sign on one side and a negative sign on the other. This ensures the function remains analytic across the cut.\nThe subtraction method in dispersion relations helps recover the full function from its imaginary part, maintaining consistency in the complex plane.\n\ng(s) = g(0) + \\frac{s}{\\pi} \\int_{s_{\\text{th}}}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Im}g(s')}{s'(s' - s)} \\, ds'\n\nThis relation is essential when the function does not decay sufficiently at high energies, requiring one or even two subtractions to ensure convergence."

The imaginary part of this expression corresponds to the imaginary part of \\sqrt{X_1 - X}.\nWe must also include the value at zero, which is non-trivial. This behavior arises because we started with an analytic function. By performing a contour integral, we can evaluate this explicitly. The imaginary part of the square root simplifies to a hypergeometric scale, yielding a real mathematical expression that may seem surprising but holds rigorously.\nNow, let’s return to the main expression. We relate the imaginary part of this block (through the optical theorem) to the cross section. Observables are given by the cross section, which is the imaginary part. This imaginary part is placed in the numerator, and we perform a dispersive integral to obtain the contribution.\nThis explains why we start at the threshold: the function is real below the threshold and only develops an imaginary part beyond it.

    "text": "4 Scaling Atomic Radii and Effective Charge\nThe outer shells of an atom extend to roughly several hundred picometers, with a clear estimation of 100. To visualize this, I compared it to our solar system. Here is Earth, and if I scale the radius of the nucleus to the orbital shells, it matches the ratio of the sun’s radius to Earth’s orbit. The sun must be scaled down by a factor of 150 to match the distances in the atom.\nThe average radius for the 1s orbital is:\n\n\\langle r \\rangle_{1s} = \\frac{3}{2} a_0\n\nFor the 2s orbital, it is:\n\n\\langle r \\rangle_{2s} = 6 a_0\n\nWhen calculating these values, I divided by the effective charge. For the 2s orbital, the effective charge is roughly 4 due to screening effects (starting with Z = 8 but reduced by inner electrons). This gives a radius close to a_0, which is why a_0 serves as a reference for atomic size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bohr radius a_0 represents the characteristic size of an atom, approximately 5.9 \\times 10^{-11} \\ \\text{m}.

It is so accurate that for the past 10 years, experiments at CERN and elsewhere have tried to find deviations from its predictions, but none have been found.\nHowever, there are unresolved problems with the Standard Model, particularly at large scales and in the context of cosmic evolution. Questions remain about the naturalness of certain couplings and parameters, which are measured precisely but lack a fundamental explanation.\nThe Standard Model can be thought of as the electroweak sector combined with QCD (quantum chromodynamics). Its success as a theory does not imply completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Standard Model’s parameters are empirically determined, but their origins remain unexplained, posing open questions for theoretical physics."

This particularly applies to quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory describing the strong interaction. Everything discussed in hadron physics is governed by the strong interaction, and QCD is the theory of the color charge.\nWhile QCD works very well for high-energy phenomena, it is so complex that until recently, direct predictions from its fundamental equations to real-world observables were not possible. The reason, which we will discuss later, is that the fundamental interaction describes the behavior of quarks and gluons—the theory’s building blocks.\nHowever, at lower energies, the theory transitions into a different regime where particles like hadrons (e.g., protons, neutrons) emerge as color-neutral objects. These are not fundamental particles but composite states where the color charge is confined.\nIn this course, we will explore how QCD, as a fundamental theory, manifests in the form of hadrons—objects where the theory’s charge is confined and only neutral combinations are observable."

It consists of a kinetic term and a potential term. When you subtract them, you get an expression representing the system’s energy (kinetic minus potential), which determines the equation of motion.\nThe evolution of the system from an initial state is described by an equation derived from the Lagrangian.

If you attempt to pull quarks apart with immense force, they will eventually separate, but new confined objects (color-neutral particles) will form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColor neutrality is essential for confinement. A particle with zero color charge does not interact via the strong force outside its bubble.

    "text": "7 Spin and SU(2) Symmetry in Quantum Mechanics\nWe can use the isospin number to understand why certain measured cross sections differ in size. For example, if we plot mass against cross section, we observe the cross section for \\pi^+ p and \\pi^- p reactions. In the delta mass region, there is a factor of three difference between these cross sections. You can explore in exercises why these differences arise between the reactions.\nThe isospin concept was introduced for protons and neutrons in the 1950s, before the discovery of quarks. Experimentally, researchers observed patterns in particle production, such as pions and later rho mesons. They grouped particles into multiplets based on symmetries, such as pions and rho mesons forming triplets, and deltas forming an isospin quadruplet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea of isospin emerged from observing similar reaction rates for processes involving protons and neutrons, suggesting the strong interaction treats them identically.\n\n\n\nBy analyzing cross sections, it became clear that the strong interaction does not distinguish between protons and neutrons, leading to the isospin symmetry framework. This concept later extended to larger patterns, such as strangeness and hypercharge, which we will discuss further.\nThe question arises: why introduce isospin when protons and neutrons differ in charge? The answer lies in reaction rates — if pp, pn, and nn interactions yield similar outcomes, it implies the strong interaction is blind to their charge differences. This observation motivated the isospin formalism."

Strangeness was introduced because some particles detected in cosmic rays behaved unusually. For example, in a cloud chamber, tracks resembling a V-shape were observed, corresponding to particles like \\pi^+, \\pi^-, and a proton. These particles always appeared in pairs and had relatively long lifetimes.\nThis led to the introduction of a new quantum number called strangeness, which was postulated to be conserved. Additionally, isospin is a quantum number conserved in strong interactions.\nFor particles composed of up and down quarks, the strangeness value is 0, as seen in pions, neutrons, and protons. Particles with strangeness +1 include hyperons like the \\Lambda.

Kaons can form isospin doublets, like K^+ and K^0, or K^- and \\overline{K^0}, with strangeness -1. Since these particles appear in pairs, strangeness must be conserved in strong interactions but not in weak interactions.\nFor example, in the decay \\Lambda \\to p + \\pi^-, the final particles have no strangeness, yet the decay occurs. This indicates strangeness violation, which is allowed in weak interactions. The same reaction would not happen if the initial particle were a proton instead of a lambda, as strangeness conservation would forbid it.\nThe hypercharge Y is defined as:\n\nY = B + S\n\nwhere B is the baryon number and S is the strangeness.

If I = \\frac{1}{2} and the first component is +\\frac{1}{2}, we can check the hypercharge. For the proton, strangeness is zero, but it’s a baryon, so B = 1. Using the formula:\n\nQ = I_3 + \\frac{Y}{2}\n\nwhere Y = B + S, we get I_3 = \\frac{1}{2} and Y = 1.

Similarly, for the neutron, I_3 = -\\frac{1}{2} and Y = 1, giving Q = 0, as expected.\nGell-Mann and Niemann discovered larger patterns for these particles by incorporating strangeness. This led to the “eightfold way,” where particles are arranged in bigger multiplets. Instead of just the up and down quarks, they included the strange quark, extending the analysis to SU(3) flavor symmetry.\nHere’s a summary of the quantum numbers for the up, down, and strange quarks:\n- Baryon number (B): Each quark has B = \\frac{1}{3}, so a proton (uud) has B = 1.\n- Charge (Q): Up quark has Q = +\\frac{2}{3}, down has Q = -\\frac{1}{3}, and strange has Q = -\\frac{1}{3}.\n- Strangeness (S): Up and down quarks have S = 0, while the strange quark has S = -1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eightfold way organizes particles based on I_3 (third component of isospin) and strangeness, revealing larger symmetry patterns.\n\n\n\nFor example, plotting I_3 against strangeness for the up, down, and strange quarks shows how these quantum numbers define particle multiplets.

These are all fermions, meaning they are spin-\\frac{1}{2} particles. We previously discussed strangeness, which is -1 for the strange quark.\nNow, let’s examine larger patterns, starting with baryons. Baryons are composed of three quarks, which can be up, down, or strange. The combination of three quarks gives us multiplets: a decuplet (10 particles) and two octets (8 particles each). These are referred to as the ground state baryons.\nThe particles can be arranged based on the third component of isospin (I_3) on the horizontal axis and strangeness (S) on the vertical axis. Some textbooks also use hypercharge (Y) instead of strangeness. The isospin multiplets are visible here:\n- A doublet for the neutron and proton,\n- A triplet for the sigmas,\n- And another doublet for the cascades.\nFor example, the isospin values here are \\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}, 0, and the strangeness values are 0, -1, -2. The quark content is also apparent: particles with one strange quark are grouped together, while those with two strange quarks form another set.\nLooking at the masses, the proton and neutron have nearly identical masses, differing by only about 1 MeV. This small mass difference is also observed in other isospin multiplets, such as the sigmas. However, along the strangeness axis, the mass differences are much larger—around 250 MeV between certain particles and 130 MeV between others.\nThis indicates that isospin symmetry in SU(2) is a good approximation, but when the strange quark is included, the symmetry is significantly broken. If the symmetry were exact, all particles in the multiplet would have the same mass.\nIn the upper row of the diagram, we have particles with strangeness 0, while the lower rows have -1, -2, -3. The highest I_3 component is plotted on this axis.\nAll these particles share a common feature: their spin and parity. The baryons in the octet have spin \\frac{1}{2} and positive parity, while those in the decuplet have spin \\frac{3}{2} and also positive parity. The spin configurations can vary, including all possible permutations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mass differences along the isospin axis are small, indicating approximate SU(2) symmetry, while the larger differences along the strangeness axis show significant symmetry breaking when the strange quark is included.\n\n\n\nThe quark content is explicitly visible in these arrangements: particles with one strange quark are grouped together, and those with two strange quarks form another distinct set. This organization helps illustrate the underlying symmetry patterns and their breaking due to the strange quark’s mass."

This was a major success for Gell-Mann, as he predicted the existence of the Omega minus, which was experimentally confirmed two years later in bubble chamber experiments.

Looking at the mass differences between the horizontal lines in the multiplet:\n- The \\Delta(1232) has a mass of 1232 MeV,\n- The sigmas follow,\n- The Omega minus has a mass around 1680 MeV.\nThe mass differences between these states are roughly 150 MeV.\nThese predictions stem from group theory and symmetry considerations, which successfully described many particles mathematically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mass spacing in the baryon decuplet follows a consistent pattern, supporting the underlying SU(3) symmetry.\n\n\n\nIf you examine the multiplet structure, the mathematical framework of group theory provides a powerful tool for understanding particle classifications and their properties."

For baryons, the parity can be calculated using:\n\nP = (-1)^L\n\nFor the octet ground states with L = 0, this gives a parity of +1 for both \\frac{1}{2}^+ and \\frac{3}{2}^+. For mesons, the parity formula is:\n\nP = (-1)^{L + 1}\n\nThis results in a parity of -1 for both cases. Charge conjugation (C) is well-defined only for neutral mesons. For example, applying it to \\pi^0 gives C = +1.\nWhen analyzing particle decays, quantum numbers like parity and C-parity are multiplicative. For instance, consider the decay of an \\omega meson into two pions. The C-parity of \\pi^0 is +1, so the product for two pions is (+1) \\times (+1) = +1. However, the \\omega meson has C = -1, making this decay forbidden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParity and C-parity are crucial for determining allowed decay channels, as they must be conserved in strong and electromagnetic interactions.\n\n\n\nFor mesons, the quark-antiquark pairs in the octet or nonet (including \\eta') have quantum numbers 0^-+, indicating anti-parallel spin orientation. Their parity is -1, and charge conjugation is +1. For the vector mesons (spin 1), the spins are aligned parallel, resulting in parity -1 and C-parity -1.\nCharge conjugation transforms a particle into its antiparticle. For baryons, if the orbital angular momentum L is known, parity can be computed as (-1)^L.\nLastly, the mass differences in the baryon decuplet follow a consistent pattern, supporting the underlying SU(3) symmetry. For example, the \\Delta(1232) has a mass of 1232 MeV, while the \\Omega^- is around 1680 MeV, with mass differences of roughly 150 MeV between states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup theory and symmetry considerations provide a powerful framework for predicting particle properties and classifications, as demonstrated by Gell-Mann’s successful prediction of the \\Omega^-."

I mentioned that all of these have aligned spins (spin up), and their flavor content is also identical. Do you see a problem here? Quarks are fermions, and according to the Pauli exclusion principle, fermions in a combined state must be distinguishable by at least one quantum number. Here, everything is the same.\nLet’s examine the total wave function of these baryons. For L = 0, the spatial wave function is symmetric. The spin wave function is also symmetric because all spins are aligned up — exchanging any quark pair leaves the state unchanged. The flavor wave function is symmetric as well, since all quarks are identical in flavor.\nWhen physicists encounter such a problem, we introduce a new quantum number. What could it be? Yes, color charge. This was briefly discussed last time. The color part of the wave function must be antisymmetric to ensure the total wave function is antisymmetric. We assign each quark a distinct color (red, green, blue), which distinguishes them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of color charge resolves the symmetry conflict in baryon wave functions, ensuring compliance with the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n\n\nNow, let’s briefly discuss an experiment confirming the number of colors. Last time, I mentioned we have three colors, but how do we know it’s not six? Experiments involving e^+e^- annihilation provided evidence. In these collisions, a virtual photon is exchanged, producing either quark-antiquark pairs or leptons (e.g., \\mu^+\\mu^-). The observed production rates for hadrons versus leptons confirmed the existence of exactly three color charges.\nThe mass of the produced systems depends on the quark-antiquark pairs formed.

Experimental measurements involve comparing cross sections for hadronic production (quark-antiquark pairs) against leptonic production (e.g., \\mu^+\\mu^-).

The rates of these interactions were practically identical. Additionally, the masses of the proton and neutron are nearly the same:\n\nm_p \\approx 938.272 \\ \\text{MeV}, \\quad m_n \\approx 939.565 \\ \\text{MeV}\n\nThis led to the idea that the proton and neutron could be treated as two states of the same particle, described by isospin.

This is analogous to electron spin, where we have spin-up or spin-down states.\nAt the quark level, protons and neutrons are composed of up and down quarks. The strong interaction does not distinguish between these flavors, meaning it treats up and down quarks identically.\nThe up quark has an isospin of \\frac{1}{2} with a third component I_3 = +\\frac{1}{2}, while the down quark has I_3 = -\\frac{1}{2}. Although isospin is not identical to spin, it can be treated mathematically like spin, following the SU(2) algebra.\nThe isospin operators are represented similarly to spin operators, with Pauli matrices acting as generators. For example, applying the I_3 operator to the up quark state yields the eigenvalue +\\frac{1}{2}. The lowering and raising operators allow transitions between different projections of isospin, which range from -I to +I in steps of 1, giving 2I + 1 possible projections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SU(2) algebra for isospin mirrors that of spin, with the same commutation relations and matrix representations.\n\n\n\nNow, let’s consider quark combinations. Mesons are formed by pairing a quark and an antiquark. For up and down quarks (each with I = \\frac{1}{2}), combining two isospin-\\frac{1}{2} particles can yield either a total isospin of 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). The resulting meson states can be classified based on their total isospin and its third component I_3."

The triplet has three projections: +1, 0, and -1, while the singlet has only one projection: 0.\nThe Glebsch-Gordan coefficients determine the signs and coefficients in front of these states.

This is why both the proton-neutron pair and the up-down quark pair are placed into an isospin doublet. Initially, isospin was introduced for nucleons, but later it was extended to quarks as more particles like pions and rho mesons were discovered.\nIn the 1960s, experiments like the Bevatron revealed over 100 new particles. Researchers struggled to categorize them until they realized these particles could be decomposed into smaller constituents (quarks). This led to the search for larger symmetry patterns, incorporating quantum numbers like strangeness.\nStrangeness was introduced to explain the behavior of certain particles. For example, cosmic ray experiments showed tracks in cloud chambers forming V-shapes, corresponding to pairs like \\pi^+ \\pi^- or proton + \\pi^-.

In these cases, all quarks have their spins aligned (all spin up) and identical flavor content. This raises a problem: quarks are fermions and must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning their total wave function must be antisymmetric under exchange.\nLet’s examine the total wave function of these baryons. For L = 0, the spatial wave function is symmetric. The spin wave function is also symmetric because all spins are aligned. The flavor wave function is symmetric as well, since all quarks are of the same flavor.\nTo resolve this, physicists introduced a new quantum number: color charge. The color part of the wave function must be antisymmetric to ensure the total wave function is antisymmetric. We assign each quark a distinct color (red, green, or blue), making them distinguishable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of color solves the Pauli exclusion problem for identical quarks in baryons and is a fundamental aspect of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).\n\n\n\nThis concept was briefly discussed earlier, and we will now transition to discussing an experiment related to these ideas."

    "text": "40 Experimental Evidence for Three Quark Colors\nWe will now discuss one last experiment to confirm the number of quark colors. Previously, I mentioned that we have three colors, but how do we know it’s three and not six, for example? Since we have six types of quarks, experiments were conducted to verify this.\nThe experiment involved studying e^+ e^- annihilation, where a virtual photon is exchanged. This process can produce different types of particles, such as quark-antiquark pairs or leptons like \\mu^+ \\mu^-. The mass of the produced systems can be measured, and the cross sections for these processes were compared.\nThe key idea is to take the ratio of cross sections:\n\nR = \\frac{\\sigma(e^+ e^- \\to \\text{hadrons})}{\\sigma(e^+ e^- \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-)}\n\nFor leptons like \\mu^+ \\mu^-, there is no color charge, but for quarks, the cross section is proportional to the number of colors. By dividing the hadronic cross section by the leptonic one, we obtain a value proportional to the number of colors.\nThe virtual photon at the vertex introduces a proportionality to the squared charge of the quarks (Q^2). At lower energies, lighter quarks (up, down, strange) dominate, and resonances like the \\rho, \\omega, and \\pi mesons appear as peaks in the spectrum. At higher energies, heavier quark-antiquark bound states such as charmonium (J/\\psi) and bottomonium (\\Upsilon) are produced.\nThe measured steps in R correspond to the thresholds for producing these heavier quarks. The exact size of these steps could be calculated, and the results consistently indicated that the number of colors must be three.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis experimental evidence strongly supports the existence of three quark colors, a fundamental aspect of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).\n\n\n\nWe will discuss this further in upcoming sessions."

Generally, what I find difficult with histories like this is understanding what was known and unknown at the time. For example, when strangeness was introduced in cosmic rays, the key question was: how do you distinguish chaotic behavior from invariant masses?\nThese particles were called “strange” because their behavior was puzzling — they appeared only in pairs and had longer lifetimes than expected. To study them, you analyze invariant masses by detecting decay products like protons and pions, then examine their spectra.\nThe known particles at the time were the proton (discovered earlier) and the neutron (1932), followed by pions shortly after. The confusion around strange particles stemmed from their unusual production and decay patterns, which later led to the introduction of strangeness as a quantum number."

    "text": "5 Extending Isospin Symmetry to Heavier Quarks\nIf you see the two light quarks, then you have to think either it’s zero or one, but if it’s one, no question. The relation to the light quarks raises a question: Why don’t you have an isospin for heavier quarks? You can have a symmetry group that relates them.\nNow, consider introducing a symmetry that acts in the space of the light quarks plus charm, or light quarks plus strange. But you must include the lower quarks as well. For example, take the charm and strange quarks. Every wave function we write would consider the dimension related to the charm-strange presence. The charm quark would be the upper component, and the strange quark would be the lower component.\nThis consideration is exactly the same as SU(2) isospin symmetry. The problem is that our Lagrangian, our nature, does not respect this symmetry. If you change strange to charm, they do not have equal masses, so the Lagrangian is not symmetric under this transformation.\nThe reason we consider u and d quarks as part of the same multiplet is that they have nearly identical masses. If you change u to d, the Lagrangian remains unchanged. The mass difference is negligible—6 MeV versus 4 MeV—so they are effectively degenerate.\nNow, compare this to the strange quark, which has a mass of around 100 MeV. At the scale of 1 GeV, where chiral symmetry breaking occurs, 100 MeV is not drastically different from the light quark masses. So, we could consider the strange quark as part of the same multiplet.\nInstead of isospin, we could introduce a quantity reflecting SU(3) symmetry, which accounts for the three quark flavors (u, d, s). This extends the concept of isospin to a larger symmetry group, describing the placement of mesons in the three-quark framework. This brings us back from isospin to the full flavor symmetry diagram."

The question arises: where does this measurement lie in the hypercharge versus strangeness plane? This naturally includes the strange quark.\nFurther, one could extend this to include the charm quark. While the charm quark is lighter than the top and bottom, we can theoretically consider a world where the charm, strange, and light quarks (u, d) have the same mass. In this scenario, mesons occupy points in a three-dimensional symmetry space:\n\nOne axis for isospin,\n\nAnother for strangeness,\n\nA third for charmness.\n\nThe symmetry implies that mesons like D^0 and D^+ are nearly identical under strong interactions, differing only by their light quark content (u vs. d). Isospin symmetry asserts that swapping u and d quarks preserves particle properties—mass, width, decay modes—since QCD (quantum chromodynamics) does not distinguish them electromagnetically.\nFor example, a meson with isospin I=1 has a “sibling” obtained by replacing u \\leftrightarrow d. This reflects the multiplet structure, where particles differing only by isospin are grouped together in experimental data (e.g., the Particle Data Group listings).\nA follow-up question arises: does this symmetry extend to antiquark combinations like \\bar{u}d and \\bar{d}u? Indeed, such pairs would also form part of the multiplet, introducing additional symmetry options.\nThis leads to the broader consideration of symmetries beyond isospin, such as SU(3) flavor symmetry, which incorporates u, d, s quarks. The framework generalizes isospin to higher dimensions, mapping mesons into larger symmetry patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe near-degeneracy of u and d quark masses (~2–6 MeV) underpins isospin symmetry. For heavier quarks (e.g., charm, strange), mass differences break the symmetry explicitly.\n\n\n\nThe discussion naturally transitions to extending isospin-like symmetries to heavier quarks, though the Lagrangian’s lack of mass degeneracy limits such generalizations."

Similarly, the D^0 (c\\bar{u}) becomes the \\bar{D}^0 (\\bar{c}u).\nThis symmetry is even more robust than isospin symmetry. Isospin symmetry is slightly broken by quark mass differences and electromagnetic charges—for instance, the u and d quarks do not have identical masses. However, the D^+ and D^0 mesons are so similar under charge conjugation that we rarely distinguish them unless studying tiny effects like CP violation in the Standard Model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharge conjugation symmetry is exceptionally precise, with deviations being negligible in most cases. These deviations are typically explored in studies beyond the Standard Model (e.g., PSM—Physics Beyond the Standard Model).\n\n\n\nThe breaking of isospin symmetry is more noticeable, particularly in observable quantities like decay modes. For example, the D^+ and D^0 exhibit different decay patterns due to mass differences, even though their underlying quantum couplings remain similar.\nA curious observation in LHCb papers is that charge-conjugated processes are implicitly assumed. For instance, when analyzing B \\to D \\mu \\nu, the charge-conjugated decay \\bar{B} \\to \\bar{D} \\mu \\nu is automatically included in the analysis. This is because the physics is identical for both processes, so they are combined without explicit mention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharge conjugation symmetry is so fundamental that experimental collaborations like LHCb do not separately report results for particle and antiparticle decays—they are treated as one.\n\n\n\nThe properties of charge-conjugated mesons are homogeneously identical unless probing extremely subtle effects.

We might revisit this when discussing deviations of the Standard Model and CP violation.\nNow, let’s discuss the second topic. It’s easier to address from the final state. You see two vector states, add them, and ask: what are the possible configurations? For example, what is the possible length of a vector made from one stick of 1 meter and another stick of 1 meter?\nHere, we have two vectors:\n\n\\vec{J}_1 with spin 1,\n\n\\vec{J}_2 with spin 1.\n\nWhen adding these spins, the possible total spin configurations are quantized in steps of 1: S = 0, 1, 2. This is one of the key concepts you’ll learn in this course—how to add spins. We’ll practice this repeatedly until it becomes clear.\nWhen combining these two vectors, the total spin can be:\n\nS = 0 (singlet state),\n\nS = 1 (triplet state),\n\nS = 2 (quintet state).\n\nThis is represented as:\n\n\\vec{J}_{\\text{total}} = \\vec{J}_1 + \\vec{J}_2\n\nOn one side, we list their individual quantum numbers; on the other, the total J. The parity (P) is multiplicative when combining them with zero orbital angular momentum (L = 0). This means they don’t rotate relative to each other—you just take one, add the second, and observe the total J. The possible values are J^P = 0^+, 1^+, 2^+. This is called the S-wave configuration.\nNow, let’s introduce orbital angular momentum (L). For L = 0, the states are straightforward. For L = 1 (P-wave), the parity flips to -, and the possible J^P combinations become:\n\n1^-,\n\n2^-,\n\n3^-.\n\nSimilarly, for L = 2 (D-wave), the possible J^P values are:\n- 2^+,\n- 3^+,\n- 4^+.\nWe can continue this for higher L (F-wave, G-wave, etc.), but for most practical purposes, we rarely go beyond F-wave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parity for a state with orbital angular momentum L is given by P = (-1)^L.\n\n\n\nThis framework allows us to systematically classify quantum states based on their spin and orbital angular momentum combinations."

When addressing this, we focus only on the first row and add two units of orbital angular momentum. The parity-forbidden angular momentum sequence is 0^+, 1^-, 2^+, 3^-, 4^+, 5^-. Starting from 0^+, we add a length of 2, resulting in 2^+. Adding it to 1^- requires careful consideration: the minimum value when subtracting is 1, and the maximum is 3, with no parity hint allowed.\nNow, for two vectors of length 2, we add another two units of orbital angular momentum. The minimal configuration is 0^+, and the maximal is 4^+, with all intermediate values having positive parity. For the F-wave, we introduce a longer stick of 3^- and examine the first row, which gives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with alternating negative parity: 1^-, 2^-, 3^-, 4^-, 5^-.\nThe key is to identify which states decay. For example, the 1^- state appears in four combinations here. Decays into two identical particles are more restrictive due to symmetry constraints. Identical particles cannot occupy certain configurations, such as those with odd L + S. For instance, L = 3 combined with S = 2 is forbidden because 3 + 2 = 5 (odd). Only one combination remains for identical particles, while four are possible for non-identical particles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor identical particles, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange if they are fermions, or symmetric if they are bosons. This restricts allowed combinations of L and S.\n\n\n\nThe process involves combining any particles with arbitrary spins and orbital angular momenta to determine possible quantum numbers. The total spin and orbital angular momentum must be combined to yield the correct J^P values. This table-filling exercise is essential for understanding decays.\nFor example, combining two vectors with spin 1 each gives total spins S = 0, 1, 2. The parity is multiplicative when L = 0, so the possible J^P states are 0^+, 1^+, 2^+ (S-wave). Introducing L = 1 (P-wave) flips the parity, yielding 1^-, 2^-, 3^-. Similarly, L = 2 (D-wave) gives 2^+, 3^+, 4^+.\n\n\\vec{J}_{\\text{total}} = \\vec{J}_1 + \\vec{J}_2 + \\vec{L}\n\nThe parity for a state with orbital angular momentum L is P = (-1)^L. This systematic approach allows us to classify quantum states based on their spin and orbital angular momentum combinations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigher orbital angular momenta (e.g., F-wave, G-wave) follow the same pattern but are rarely needed in practice. The key is to understand the minimal and maximal configurations when adding spins and orbital angular momenta."

We use electromagnetic interactions by scattering electrons off protons and analyzing the reaction in the kinematic phase space.\nThe electron is a point-like particle, so its interaction with the proton’s electromagnetic field is straightforward and well understood.

If the momentum transferred in this reaction is small, you get the characteristics of the proton itself. But if you go to the regime of high transferred momentum, where a lot of energy is taken from the proton, you start probing its internals.\nThis is the idea behind elastic scattering experiments at large accelerator facilities, which have been built to study this very process. The U.S. hadron physics program for the next 10 years promises to focus on this, particularly with the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Instead of protons, heavier ions like carbon will be scattered with electrons to study quantum electrodynamics in this process.\nThere is much to understand about the proton—it is not just a simple object. It contains quarks, gluons, and dynamic interactions between them. We have some understanding of how quarks are distributed inside the proton and what fraction of the proton’s momentum they carry. However, what remains unclear is the behavior of perpendicular fluctuations—what happens off the axis of transferred momentum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe momentum transfer Q^2 determines whether the electron interacts with the proton as a whole (low Q^2) or resolves its internal quark structure (high Q^2).\n\n\n\nThis unresolved question is one of the key motivations for further study of electron-proton scattering.

The total energy in the system is determined by the colliding beams, and the scattering angle of the electron is the other key observable. More familiar quantities include the total energy-momentum in the system and the scattering angle in the center-of-mass frame.\nHowever, the Mandelstam variables s and t are more natural and widely used. The variable s is computed as the square of the sum of the four-momenta of the initial-state particles:\n\ns = (p_1 + p_2)^2\n\nThe variable t represents the energy transfer from the initial to the final state and is given by:\n\nt = (p_e - p_e')^2\n\nHere, p_e and p_e' are the four-momenta of the initial and final electrons, respectively. These quantities are related, and in the center-of-momentum frame, they can be expressed in terms of s.\nFor example, in the center-of-momentum frame, the total energy E_{\\text{total}} is equal to \\sqrt{s}. The four-momenta can be decomposed into energy and spatial components, where the spatial momenta satisfy \\vec{p}_e^* = -\\vec{p}_p^* (the asterisk denotes the center-of-momentum frame).\nThe Mandelstam variable t can also be written explicitly in terms of energy and momentum components:\n\nt = m_e^2 + m_e^2 - 2(E_e E_e' - \\vec{p}_e \\cdot \\vec{p}_e')\n\nThis simplifies further in the center-of-momentum frame, where the scalar product of the spatial momenta reduces to |\\vec{p}_e^*|^2 \\cos \\theta, with \\theta being the scattering angle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mandelstam variables s and t are Lorentz-invariant, making them particularly useful for analyzing scattering processes across different reference frames.\n\n\n\nAll kinematic quantities in the center-of-momentum frame can ultimately be expressed in terms of s, allowing for a streamlined description of the scattering process. For instance, the energy of each particle in this frame is directly related to \\sqrt{s}, and the momentum transfer t depends on s and the scattering angle."

To compute the differential cross section, we use the matrix element of the reaction. The squared matrix element |M|^2 represents the probability of a reaction occurring at a specific kinematic point. The total cross section is obtained by integrating over the entire kinematic domain, summing the matrix elements weighted by the available phase space configurations.\nPhase space can be thought of as the number of configurations in which a reaction can occur. For discrete variables like spin, this is intuitive, but for continuous kinematic variables (e.g., scattering angle \\theta), it requires integration. For example, to calculate the total cross section, you must integrate over all possible \\theta.\nThe flux factor normalizes the wave functions of the colliding particles and is given by a kinematic factor like:\n\nJ = 2E_1 2E_2 (v_1 - v_2)\n\nwhere E_1, E_2 are the energies and v_1, v_2 the velocities of the incoming particles.

Here, Q is proportional to \\sin \\theta, but it is more precise to refer to Q directly since it is a measurable quantity. The 1/Q^2 term in the expression leads to the 1/\\sin^4 \\theta divergence at small angles.\nFor very forward scattering (small \\theta), the dependence becomes 1/\\theta^4, which is non-integrable. This necessitates regularization techniques to handle the divergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe terms E_1 and E_3 correspond to the electron’s initial and final energies, respectively."

When you introduce this exponential dependence, you obtain a pole-like behavior, which is referred to as dipole parameterization. This will be explored further in the homework.\nBy measuring the Q dependence experimentally (e.g., on the lattice), we extract parameters of the spatial distribution. A key question in the field is: What is the charge radius of the proton? Many experiments have attempted to measure this using various techniques, and lattice calculations also address this problem.\nOne of the quantities extracted from lattice computations is the Q dependence, obtained through first-principles numerical calculations. Performing a Fourier transformation on this dependence yields the spatial distribution, from which the charge radius can be determined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe magnetic moment of the hadron is another important quantity related to these form factors.\n\n\n\nThe magnetic moment is derived from G_M(Q^2) at Q = 0:\n\nG_M(0) = \\int M(r) \\, dr\n\nThis integral represents the total magnetic moment of the hadron. At leading order, this is the dominant contribution, but corrections can be computed up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). These corrections primarily arise from the electron side, which is well understood. On the proton side, the expression for G_M(Q^2) is the most general form possible.\nWhile it is possible to derive the form factor functions at higher orders (NLO, NNLO), this is computationally challenging and rarely done in practice. Instead, researchers typically focus on the leading-order contributions."

The magnetic moment for a particle is given by:\n\n\\vec{\\mu} = \\frac{e}{2m} \\vec{S}\n\nHere, \\vec{S} is the spin operator for a fermion (spin-1/2 particle). However, this relation is modified by the geomagnetic ratio (or g-factor), leading to:\n\n\\vec{\\mu} = g \\frac{e}{2m} \\vec{S}\n\nThe standard magnetic moment of the particle is called the geomagnetic ratio, where \\frac{e}{m} is the charge-to-mass ratio.

    "text": "30 Quark Model Foundations and Emergent Degrees of Freedom\nIf you look at the flavor-spin wave function for the problem, we can write the proton as the composition of the wave function of its core content. Then, we act with the magnetic moment operator on the proton and compute its magnetic moment in terms of the magnetic moments of the quarks. We can do the same for the neutron and find that the ratio is roughly as expected.\nThe reason this approach is correct comes from the fact that the strong interaction is confined to small scales where quarks are inside the proton. The entire color interaction sits within the proton. Quarks and gluons interact, and the emergent degrees of freedom arise when we consider multiplets and symmetries based on the quarks. The quarks are the leading degrees of freedom, and they gain mass.\nThe quarks in the Standard Model Lagrangian are current quarks with negligible mass, while the emergent (constituent) quarks acquire significant mass and carry most of the degrees of freedom. The quark model integrates gluonic degrees of freedom and attributes mass to the quarks. We start with nearly massless quarks, but after integrating gluons, we end up with a system where three quarks (each roughly 300 MeV) form the proton.\nThe up quark ( u ) has a charge of +2/3, and the down quark ( d ) has a charge of -1/3. These quarks carry 1/3 of the baryon number and govern the degrees of freedom. The proton’s magnetic moment can be expressed as:\n\n\\mu_p = \\frac{2}{3} \\mu_u - \\frac{1}{3} \\mu_d\n\nThis framework explains why the proton and neutron have non-trivial magnetic moments, deviating from the Dirac particle expectation.

    "text": "0.1 Angular Distributions, Kinematics Variables, and Dalitz Plots in Two- and Three-Body Scattering\nToday we are at lecture number five. We’ll discuss angular distributions and partial wave analysis. But before going there, I would like to start with a recap.\n\nIn the last lecture, we discussed:\n\nThe phase space for particle reactions\nDifferent experiments and their kinematics\nA list of experiments worldwide studying hadrons, their production mechanisms, and peculiarities\n\n\nWe start with a recap on kinematics. The first question: How many variables does one need to describe the two-particle scattering process? We have two problems:\n\nScalar particles (e.g., 0-minus scalars):\n\n\nScattering of 0-minus → 0-minus, with two 0-minus scalar particles in the final state.\n\n\nParticles with spin (e.g., P-plus):\n\n\nScattering of 0-minus → 3-minus and 1-plus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scattering process is represented by a “blob” in diagrams. These are unitarity diagrams (not Feynman diagrams), illustrating interactions without specifying dynamics.\n\n\n\n\nThe question: How many variables describe the full kinematics?\n\nThe blob’s internal dynamics (strong, EM, gravity) do not affect the answer.\nTwo cases:\n(A) Particles without spin\n(B) Particles with spin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor (C), provide an example of a variable combination that fully describes the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with 8 variables (2 particles × 4-momenta, minus 4 conservation constraints).\nSubtract 6 more (3 rotations + 3 boosts) due to lack of reference frame.\n\n\nFinal answer: 2 variables for (A).\n\nFor (B), the answer is also 2 variables, but the amplitude becomes a higher-rank object (e.g., 21-dimensional for spin-3 × spin-1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight: Spin adds more amplitudes, but all depend on the same two variables (s and t). Decays of final-state particles introduce additional variables, but for pure 2→2 scattering, two suffice.\n\n\n\n\nThe most common choice for kinematic variables: \ns = (p_1 + p_2)^2 \\quad \\text{(center-of-mass energy squared)}\n \nt = (p_1 - p_3)^2 \\quad \\text{(momentum transfer squared)}\n \nu = (p_1 - p_4)^2 \\quad \\text{(crossing-related invariant)}\n with the constraint s + t + u = \\sum m_i^2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are Lorentz-invariant—they don’t depend on the reference frame.\n\n\n\n\n\nHenrik’s choice: Masses of particle pairs (e.g., m_{12}^2, m_{13}^2).\nSven’s choice: s and u (equivalent to s and t via linear combinations).\nFavorite choice: Center-of-mass energy (\\sqrt{s}) and scattering angle (\\theta).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny two independent variables work, but some choices (like Mandelstam) avoid phase-space folding.\n\n\n\n\nFor three-body decay, the kinematics are similarly described by two variables (e.g., s_{12} and s_{23}).\nThe phase space is flat in these variables: \n\\frac{dN}{ds_{12} \\, ds_{23}} = \\text{constant (if no dynamics)}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDalitz plots visualize dynamics in three-body decays. A uniform distribution implies no resonant interactions; deviations reveal underlying physics.\n\n\n\n\nFor multi-body decays, phase space can be decomposed using: \nd\\Phi_n = d\\Phi_{n-1} \\cdot d\\Phi_2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^3} dp^2\n\nThis yields for three-body decays: \nd\\Phi_3 = \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2} \\frac{2p}{\\sqrt{s}} \\frac{d\\Omega}{4\\pi}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jacobian for transforming to Mandelstam variables is constant, so Dalitz plots directly reflect dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n0.2 Charm Decay Dynamics and Dalitz Plot Analysis of \\Lambda_c \\to p K \\pi\nYou can see the example of the triple decay that I have here of the \\Lambda_c baryon going to the proton, kaon, and pion. We measure \\Lambda_c produced in proton-proton collisions or any other collisions. In the BES experiment and Belle experiment, they observe \\Lambda_c.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\Lambda_c is one of the particles that lives a long time and is produced abundantly. Particles with charm ground states are produced abundantly, and they live sufficiently long to fly from the primary vertex.\n\n\n\nWe reconstruct them, which is why we have a good sample and a good understanding of their decay kinematics—and dynamics as well, the content of this blob.\n\nIn that decay, you see there is a charm quark in the initial state and no charm quark in the final state, indicating this happens via weak interaction. The charm quark disappears between the initial and final states. The charm quark decays, transitioning into the strange quark that ends up in the kaon.\nThe c \\to s transition happens within one generation, and this is not suppressed—it is an allowed process. This is the golden channel for reconstructing because in the final state you have three charged particles—no neutrals.\n\nThe proton is a nice charged particle; it travels and is stable.\nThe kaon is stable in our experiments, and the pion is stable.\n\nThey fly out from the decay without any distraction, and we see the tracks clearly through all detectors. We observe them pointing away from the primary interaction.\n\nThere is around a 10-millimeter shift in \\Lambda_c decay vertices between the primary and secondary vertex—roughly one centimeter. This is due to the boost and the fact that \\Lambda_c in the laboratory frame lives longer than in its rest frame.\n\n\\Delta x = \\gamma v \\tau_0 \\approx \\text{10 mm (observed)}\n\nwhere \\gamma = E_{\\Lambda_c}/m_{\\Lambda_c} is the Lorentz factor.\nIt has a few hundred GeV when produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. This is a super nice decay, and we’ve studied it extensively.\n\nHere is the experimental result of the analysis, which resembles the data. If I showed you the actual experimental data, you wouldn’t distinguish it from this plot because the statistics are so high that the distribution is very smooth.\n\nX-axis: Mass of the proton-kaon system m_{PK}^2 = (p_P + p_K)^2.\nY-axis: Mass of the kaon-pion system m_{K\\pi}^2 = (p_K + p_\\pi)^2, covering all allowed values for the decay.\n\nThe colored region shows kinematically allowed configurations, while the white area corresponds to forbidden kinematics.\nIf I select a point inside the plot, I can compute the angles between particles and reconstruct the kinematics. But if you ask about the white area, I’d find that energy is not conserved—those points are impossible. The range of possible values for invariants is limited, and this surface is called the Dalitz plot.\n\nDifferent colors on this plot indicate different probabilities for the decay to occur. We measure the decay, reconstruct the particle tracks, and determine the kinematic point since there’s a direct relation between four-vectors and the kinematics. Certain kinematics are more probable than others—particles prefer specific directions.\nFor this decay, some configurations are rarer than others. You should be able to identify this pattern in the plot. Here’s the hint: particles are aligned in one line on the border of the plot. Inside the surface, they always have an angle between them, but on the border, they are collinear. Think about how to maximize the mass and where this point lies.\n\nAny thoughts? You should look at the bottom right. To maximize the mass of PK, consider the three momenta in opposite directions. The sum of the momentum vectors should be as small as possible. If you add them, the forward momentum—the sum of the squares—should be as large as possible. So we should be on the right side of the diagram.\nFor the minimal mass, the three momenta are aligned, and we subtract them. If you boost to the rest frame of K and \\pi, they fly next to each other with small relative momentum. In their rest frame, they might both be at rest, so their mass would just be the sum of their masses—this is the minimum.\nWe are looking for the minimal mass of the kinematics. This point corresponds to the case where two particles have maximal momentum and go back-to-back. This plot is from experimental data, and we reconstruct this in the lab frame where everything is boosted. Even if the proton is at rest in the lab frame, it’s already boosted. This point is the maximum mass, where particles go back-to-back.\n\nFor three-body decay, we define the angle similarly. Let me fix the mass of the K\\pi system. In the center-of-momentum frame, I have three particles with zero net momentum. If I boost to the K\\pi rest frame, they go back-to-back. The length of the vectors is fixed, and only the angle \\theta changes. I explore the full range of \\theta from 0 to \\pi.\nThe right side corresponds to \\theta = 0, and the left to \\theta = \\pi. For the proton-K system, \\theta = 0 gives a high mass, while \\theta \\approx \\pi gives a small mass. The same logic applies to the other pair.\nThere is a third variable in 2-to-2 scattering called U, but for three particles, it’s symmetric. If I fix the mass of one system and scan the angle, the U variable is a linear combination of the other two. This line represents the fixed mass of the \\pi p system.\n\nThe standard Dalitz plot uses m_{PK}^2 and m_{K\\pi}^2 on the axes. A more symmetric representation uses an equilateral triangle, where distances to the sides correspond to masses. This is a linear transformation of the standard plot, involving \\sqrt{3}/2 due to the 60° angles.\nThe goal is to understand the dynamics—why certain kinematics are more probable. In future lectures, we’ll see that intermediate resonances enhance the decay probability. Two particles briefly form a resonance, increasing the likelihood of decay at specific energies.\n\nYou’ve seen cross sections for two-particle resonances with bumps indicating hadronic resonances. If the quantum numbers match, the system resonates at certain energies, increasing interaction probability. This creates structures in the Dalitz plot—projecting them shows resonance-like shapes.\nIn this decay, resonances appear in all three pairs: - Horizontal lines: Resonances in K\\pi (e.g., K^*). - Vertical lines: Resonances in pK. - Diagonal lines: Resonances in \\pi p (e.g., \\Delta).\nThe symmetric plot shows these as lines parallel to the triangle’s sides. The angular distribution within a resonance band reveals spin effects. If I fix m_{K\\pi} and vary \\theta, the probability changes because the intermediate resonance (e.g., K^*) has spin. Particles prefer certain alignments—this inhomogeneity comes from spin.\nThe decay rate depends on the angle as:\n\n\\frac{d\\Gamma}{d\\cos\\theta} \\propto 1 + \\alpha \\cos^2\\theta\n\nwhere \\alpha depends on the resonance spin. This explains why some configurations are more probable than others.\n\n\n0.3 Angular Distributions, Spin, and Wigner D-Functions in Particle Decays\nVery good. So 15 minutes before the end, we start with the lecture of today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngular distribution is a very powerful tool to understand properties of particles. As we already discussed, that’s our way to measure spin, parity, and other quantum numbers in particle interactions.\n\n\n\n\nParticles with higher spin would prefer more bumpy, more spiky angular distributions.\nParticles with lower spin—if everything is scalar—are going to produce no asymmetries at all, no structures in angular distributions.\n\nBy looking at the angular distribution, especially in the rest frame of the particle decay, one examines the ratio of the aligned kinematics and other types of kinematics. And then, with this, one can infer the information about the spin.\n\nFor most of the particles that we have discovered up to now, the quantum numbers are not known. We discover particles as bumps in the spectrum, and then the next step—in order to understand their properties—is to determine their quantum numbers. This is done by looking at angular distributions.\nMost of the time, it’s as simple as looking at the Dalitz plot and seeing: - If there is a minimum in the angular distribution. - If this line has several structures, several nodes.\nThe maxima and nodes indicate, in the case of scalar particles in the final state, the nodes would literally tell you the spin: - If you have one node, you have spin one. - If you have two nodes, you have spin two. - If you have three nodes, you have spin three.\nSo the intensity would really vanish at certain points—the dark spots.\n\nBut in the case where it’s not scalar—and most of the time, it’s not scalar particles that interact—the situation is a little bit more complicated. I will have examples of scalar resonances. But here, let’s just quickly check what spin they are giving here:\n\nBaryon (proton) spin: \\frac{1}{2}\nKaon and pion (except scalars): spin 0\nLambda: same as proton, but with the jump, the presence of spin averages out the distribution.\n\nIf you consider a certain spin projection of the \\Lambda_c and proton, you’ll again have nodes and zeros in the angular distribution. But since we don’t polarize the initial-state \\Lambda, and we don’t measure the spin of the final state—everything is averaged. Therefore, you don’t have minima, you don’t have nodes or zeros any longer; things get smeared.\n\nA particle with spin can have 2J + 1 projections onto the quantization axis. Let me consider a particle that has spin J. There is a z-axis that we need to quantize the spin, and this z-axis measures the J_z upper layer is going to give us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state |JM\\rangle can be thought of as a vector of 2J + 1 components. All operators in this case are matrices that act on these vectors and produce either: - The same state with a certain eigenvalue, or - A mixture of the states.\n\n\n\nWhen I act with the rotation on the state, I’m going to produce not a certain state, but a mixture of different states—it’s as simple as that. When I rotate the state, if it were a vector in regular space, I could probably adjust this to have exactly a certain projection. But in quantum mechanics, it doesn’t work this way.\nOnce you act with the rotation, most of the time you’re going to end up with a mixture of all states. These coefficients are tabulated, so they are known functions for any state. You can have a look and check what these coefficients are. They are called Wigner D-functions.\n\nLet me be more concrete. I’m going to rotate about the Y-axis in a second. I have a Z, I have my X, and I have my Y—XYZ. They should form the right-handed triple of axes X, Y, Z.\nI’m going to rotate about the Y-axis and apply it to |JM\\rangle. In order to do that, I have to—so J_+, as you remember, it’s:\n\nJ_+ = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad J_- = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n\nThe J_y operator then has zero on the diagonal and these coefficients above and below the diagonal. To apply the transformation to the state, you have to do the matrix exponential of J_y. But this is done for you, and we know what they are.\nThese are these coefficients—where they are C, C, C, C. You need to know about the initial state as well. That’s why the JM indices are kept in these notations.\n\nLet’s take an example—a very small one—of spin one-half. I’m going to rotate the state |1/2, 1/2\\rangle by 30 degrees about the Y-axis. I’m going to get a |1/2, 1/2\\rangle plus |1/2, -1/2\\rangle combination, and I want you to quickly tell me what are the numbers here.\nThese coefficients are sitting in the same place—where sitting in the same page as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. They are closely related. This is about the SU(2) group, and you just open the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and check the numbers.\nSince 30 degrees is not at all trivial to do it, but now we won’t have time to look at details, and hopefully in the seminar we will explore a little bit more. I just remember this table because it’s super simple.\nThe D for m' = m = \\pm 1/2 is:\n\nd^{1/2}(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) & -\\sin(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) & \\cos(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}\n\nI should have picked 60 degrees because for 15 degrees it’s a little bit inconvenient. What is going to be here is the cosine of 15 degrees. What’s going to be here is the sine of 15 degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematica has an opposite convention to what we use.\nWikipedia is the most reliable source for Wigner D-function conventions.\nThey’re coded correctly in Python (SymPy) and ROOT.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me stress what we discussed so far was not about weak interactions or strong interactions. It was about rotations and the rotational group.\nThat’s the fun part—and something that still impresses me—that in order to understand how particles behave and what the angular distributions are, you need little from the strong interaction. You only need the general properties of the rotational group, so to speak.\nAngular distributions are determined by: 1. General properties of how space is rotated, plus 2. A little bit that we need from strong interactions.\nSpecifically: - Strong interactions tell us what is the preference for which spin particles are produced. - Quantum group properties determine how they decay and what the asymmetry is in the kinematics.\nThat’s amazing. Therefore, we can now move on and have a recipe, or a general way, to construct any particle decay chain and figure out what the angular distribution is going to be.\n\nLet’s now explore the blob that I had in the previous slide and then consider one of the possible decay kinematics, one of the possible decay dynamics. Now we’re going to make up a model for what is inside of the blob.\nIt’s not just kinematics—it really comes from a modeling assumption, and I’m going to assume that three particles in the final state are produced via a cascade process where: 1. The initial particle goes first to the intermediate particle with spin J. 2. Then X decays to 1 and 2.\nA three-way process with two variable spins just gives the dimension of the matrix—discrete dimensions. For this problem, since all the particles have spin, I’m going to deal with the dimensions, which is a product of:\n\n\\text{Dim} = \\prod_{i=0}^3 (2j_i + 1)\n\nIf a particle’s spin is 0, then the dimension of the corresponding spin is 1. That’s easy.\nBut in the general case, you have many of these two-variable functions, and the way to write the amplitude is to sum over the intermediate spin and to…\n\n\n0.4 Helicity Amplitudes and Rotation Matrices in Cascade Decays\nAnother thing I would like to say is that for simplicity, we are going to align. We are going to consider this X_3—they are different resonances, the two resonances from RTPX, and X reland has to go through from the initial state.\nYou look at it in the center-of-mass (c.m.) frame, correct? So that’s the general expression. It’s extendable to any cascade decays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general decay amplitude formula combines a model-independent part (carrier group-driven angle independence) and dynamics (particle interactions): \n\\mathcal{A} = \\sum_{\\lambda} H_{\\lambda} D^{J*}_{\\lambda_0, \\lambda_X - \\lambda_3}(\\phi, \\theta) D^{J_X}_{\\lambda_X, \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2}(\\theta', \\phi')\n - H_{\\lambda}: Dynamics (weak/strong/EM interactions) - D^{J}: Wigner rotation matrices - \\lambda_i: Helicity states\n\n\n\nI’d like to give you a general formula, and we will only have time to understand it rather than derive it. It has two components: a model-independent part, carrier group-driven angle independence, and then bits of the particle interactions that you have to insert.\nThe H’s are the remaining dark blobs that hide inside the dynamics of the particles. This is what comes from the weak interactions, strong interactions, electromagnetic interactions, whatever you have. This physics is actually sitting there, and the rest is the rotational properties of the system.\nSo this H is the physics, and for the hard interactions, this is something unknown because we don’t have a way to parameterize it. By this H, what we mean is that you have a particle \\Lambda X number three. This is what’s three particles: \\Lambda X, \\Lambda_3^0, decaying into two.\nThe other H degree, plus this X going to particles 1, 2, and the G. The G is the rotation orientation of the decay.\nThe first index tells you who decays. The second index gives where it decays. The particles now have their spin in the frame where the particle moves. The most natural way to use the spin—to actually quantize the spin—is the quantized direction of the spin, which is the direction of motion.\nIn that case, \\Lambda’s are helicity projections—projection to motion to P. The D has the first index telling you who decays, and the second index, after rotation, where it decays, and then the particle zero.\nLet’s look at the particle X. The particle X carries the spin projection \\lambda_X. It decays to particles 1 and 2, which are going at a certain angle with respect to the direction of motion of X.\nTo compensate for this angle, one has to adjust the quantization axis. This is done by rotating the spin—rotating the vector of X to the direction in which it decays. From that combination, one has to rotate to the new combination, and that’s what is indicated by the rotation orientation of the decay rotation.\nI would like to evaluate this expression in the aligned kinematics—\\phi = \\theta = 0. Here is the CM frame. This is the expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn aligned kinematics (\\theta = \\phi = 0), the amplitude simplifies to: \n\\mathcal{A}_{\\text{aligned}} = \\sum_{\\lambda_X} H_{\\lambda_X} \\delta_{\\lambda_0, \\lambda_X - \\lambda_3} D^{J_X}_{\\lambda_X, \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2}(\\theta)\n The Kronecker delta \\delta_{\\lambda_0, \\lambda_X - \\lambda_3} enforces angular momentum conservation.\n\n\n\nIf you evaluate that, what you get is the amplitude \\mathcal{A} that depends on S and C and all \\lambda’s. Let’s evaluate when angles are zero.\nThe transformations reduce because the D-matrix appears due to rotation. But if angles are zero, we don’t have to rotate. We can significantly reduce the summation over \\lambda_X.\nWe don’t have to rotate because X is already moving on the Z-axis. Therefore, we get a sum over \\lambda_X, \\lambda_X, \\lambda_3, and then D of zero angles: D^{J}_{\\lambda_0, \\lambda_X - \\lambda_3}(0).\nAnother piece is \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, and the adjustment for \\lambda_X, \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2 of \\theta and \\phi.\nThis gives a delta function \\delta_{\\lambda_0, \\lambda_X - \\lambda_3}. If we don’t have to rotate, the only way to get the same state is if the state remains unchanged.\nSo X is constrained from that. The final expression is: \n\\mathcal{A}_{\\text{final}} = H_0 \\, D^{J_X}_{\\lambda_0 + \\lambda_3, \\lambda_3} \\, D^{J_X}_{\\lambda_0 + \\lambda_3, \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2}(\\theta)\n As simple as that.\n\n\n\n0.5 Predicting Angle Distributions and Partial Wave Analysis in Particle Decays\nHow many numbers do I need from you in order to compute? I want to think now about electromagnetic interactions, or let me do gravity. How many numbers as input do I need from you to predict the angle distribution? It’s essentially here, but it misses fundamental components.\n\nWhat is inside of the blobs? What’s inside of this block, this blob or this blob and this blob? In order to predict all of my values, I just need this guy and that guy.\n\nThe number of spin states for two particles with spins j_1 and j_2 is given by: \n(2j_1 + 1) \\times (2j_2 + 1)\n These values might be functions of particle masses as well—could be masses of x.\nA similar number of these terms is needed, but there is a reasonable way to approximate them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximation in Experiments: Often, in the first analysis attempt, these terms are assumed to be constant, containing only particle properties.\n\n\n\nHere I’m going to say that this one is constant one or c, and this is particle. And then once I do that, I should be able to compute what the angle distribution is.\n\nIn that case, I am going to fix the mass of the one tube and the intensity that I see along the line. What is up to now is that these two have a: \n\\frac{d\\Gamma}{d\\cos\\theta}\n\nWhy cosine? - Cosine is just better—it has a better Jacobian. - We don’t need to have this sine Jacobian for cosine.\nThat’s why often what is looked at is the cosine, and this is going to be the matrix element proportional to the matrix element. And this |M|^2 is fixed.\n\nThis distribution changes from -1 to 1. So here is the \\theta and the \\cos\\theta. \\theta is going to be null here at -1.\nWe scan from -1 to 1, and if it is flat, that’s one possibility. What you often see, especially when you deal with particles with spin, is such a parabola—a second-order polynomial in cosine. Or what you also often see is this.\nNotice the difference: - What we wrote here, A, is the quantum transition amplitude. - It’s a probability amplitude. - It’s one that is going to be squared to give us the observed probability. - This G is going to appear squared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Observations: - In experiments, we only see the squared value of the amplitude. - For unpolarized decays, distributions are averaged: \n  \\overline{|M|^2} = \\frac{1}{(2s_1 + 1)(2s_2 + 1)} \\sum_{\\text{spins}} |M|^2\n  \n\n\n\n\nThe first way to analyze that is not to guess the amplitude, but rather to use or acknowledge these angle distributions by projecting onto orthogonal polynomials because it gives you a nice basis.\n\nThe differential cross-section can be expanded as: \n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\cos\\theta} \\propto \\sum_{\\ell} a_\\ell P_\\ell(\\cos\\theta)\n where P_\\ell(\\cos\\theta) are Legendre polynomials, and \\ell relates to the spin of the produced particle.\n\nThis is what is called partial wave analysis. Or if you project the differential cross section, this is called moment analysis.\n\nPartial wave analysis models cross-sections by amplitudes, treating these terms as free parameters.\nMoment analysis projects angle distributions onto polynomials, yielding combinations of conditions.\n\n\nI didn’t tell you much about the differences between the canonical state that we introduced at the beginning and the helicity state that we introduced later. So we only touched a little bit on how the state is defined in the rest frame, and hopefully, we will get to explore more.\n\nI would like to tell you that this book has the best coverage of this subject. This is Martin Spearman’s Elementary Particle Theory, and Chapter 4 is fundamental.\n\nIt starts from the Lorentz group.\nIntroduces vectors with a bit of group theory—without heavy details.\nA really good book for insights on particle definitions.\n\n\n\n0.6 Identifying Decays via Dalitz Plot Kinematics\nI left you with an exercise, not a quiz. There are some Dalitz plots from CLEO and BaBar, and I have removed the labels. I don’t tell you which particles are in the final state. I only mention that one of them is a D decay and another is a D_s decay.\nYou already know a lot about kinematics, so the exercise is to figure out what decay this is. The axis labels are still there, but you don’t know the masses. From the kinematics, you can deduce the masses and possibly guess the decay.\nI have multiple cases. I would assign one to your group, and then you’d get another one—the EP one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Kinematic Relations for Dalitz Plots: For a 3-body decay D \\to ABC, the invariant masses of two-particle combinations are: \nm_{AB}^2 = (p_A + p_B)^2, \\quad m_{BC}^2 = (p_B + p_C)^2\n The total invariant mass constraint is: \nm_{AB}^2 + m_{BC}^2 + m_{AC}^2 = m_D^2 + m_A^2 + m_B^2 + m_C^2\n Boundary conditions for the Dalitz plot are: \n(m_{AB}^2)_{\\text{min}} = (m_A + m_B)^2, \\quad (m_{AB}^2)_{\\text{max}} = (m_D - m_C)^2\n\n\n\n\nI have to leave now. Would you like to take it? No? Okay, it’s more like homework.\nSorry about that. Come with me, and I’ll give it to you from my office. The rest of you as well.\nThanks for coming, and sorry for being slightly late. Will you have time tomorrow at 8 a.m.?\n\nFor the Dalitz plot analysis of a 3-body decay D \\to ABC, the relevant kinematic relations are: - Invariant masses of two-particle combinations: \nm_{AB}^2 = (p_A + p_B)^2, \\quad m_{BC}^2 = (p_B + p_C)^2\n - Total invariant mass constraint: \nm_{AB}^2 + m_{BC}^2 + m_{AC}^2 = m_D^2 + m_A^2 + m_B^2 + m_C^2\n - Boundary conditions for the Dalitz plot: \n(m_{AB}^2)_{\\text{min}} = (m_A + m_B)^2, \\quad (m_{AB}^2)_{\\text{max}} = (m_D - m_C)^2\n\nThese formulas are essential for reconstructing the decay kinematics and identifying the final-state particles."
